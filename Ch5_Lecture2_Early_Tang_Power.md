# LECTURE 2: Early Tang Foundations of Power

**50 minutes | Focus: How did Taizong and his successors build Tang China into the most powerful empire in East Asia?**

## Structure:

### 1. **Hook** (4 minutes):
Li Shimin killed his own brothers, executed their sons, and forced his father to abdicate. Yet he's remembered as one of China's greatest emperors. How did Taizong (his reign name) transform from ruthless general to model Confucian ruler?

### 2. **Tang Founding and Taizong's Rise** (10 minutes):
- Li Yuan and son Li Shimin from same northwest military aristocracy as Sui
- Li Shimin brilliant military commander from age 18
- Defeated rivals one by one from 618-621
- 626: Ambushed and killed two brothers, forced father to abdicate
- **Despite violent beginnings**, became known for selecting wise advisers and listening to criticism
- Compiled standard editions of Confucian classics and dynastic histories
- Issued Tang legal code that influenced Vietnam, Korea, and Japan

### 3. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #1** (3 minutes):
Partner Discussion: Can someone who gains power through violence become a good ruler? What does Taizong's reign tell us about how we evaluate historical figures?

### 4. **Tang Government Structure** (11 minutes):
- Retained Sui innovations: strong central control, examination system
- Equal-field system redistributed land regularly
- Divisional militia (fubing): farmer-soldiers served in rotation
- Low taxes made registration easier, reaching 9 million households by 609
- Government schools prepared sons of officials for service
- **Two main examinations**: mingjing (classics knowledge) and jinshi (literary skill and policy essays)
- Civil recruitment reduced power of old aristocracy

### 5. **Dominating the Turks and Central Asia** (10 minutes):
- New Turkish confederation emerged as dominant steppe power in 6th century
- Tang used diplomatic and military strategies: fortifications, trade, marriages, divide-and-conquer
- 630: Taizong defeated Turks, won title "Great Khan"
- Tang dominated steppe for next 50 years
- **Joint Chinese-Turkish campaigns** into Central Asia (640s-650s)
- Regained Han Dynasty overlordship in region
- Used Turkish troops, settled Turkish families in capital
- **Korean campaigns**: Allied with Silla to finally defeat Goguryeo in 668

### 6. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #2** (3 minutes):
Think-Pair-Share: The Tang used Turks to fight Turks, and recruited former enemies into their armies. What does this strategy reveal about Tang imperial ideology?

### 7. **Chang'an: Cosmopolitan Capital** (6 minutes):
- Largest capital yet: nearly 6 miles east-west, over 5 miles north-south
- Grid layout with 108 walled wards
- Population over 2 million with suburbs
- Attracted envoys, merchants, pilgrims from across Asia
- Foreign religions practiced: Nestorian Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Islam
- Foreign fashions, music, and polo popular at court

### 8. **Wrap-up** (3 minutes):
The early Tang created institutional foundations for a multi-ethnic empire. Next lecture: We'll see how Tang power reached its height under Empress Wu and Xuanzong, then collapsed during the An Lushan Rebellion.

**Big Question**: How did the Tang balance Chinese cultural identity with their multi-ethnic military origins and cosmopolitan empire?
