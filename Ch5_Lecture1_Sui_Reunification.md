# LECTURE 1: Sui Reunification and Early Tang Foundations

**50 minutes | Focus: How did the Sui and early Tang overcome centuries of division to rebuild a unified Chinese empire?**

## Structure:

### 1. **Hook** (4 minutes):
After nearly 400 years of division, China is about to be reunited by a dynasty that will last only 37 years. How did such a short-lived dynasty lay the groundwork for one of China's greatest eras?

### 2. **The Northwest Military Aristocracy** (10 minutes):
- Yang Jian rises from mixed ethnic background (Chinese-Xianbei heritage common in northwest)
- Usurps Northern Zhou throne in 581 after marrying into royal family
- Represents new hybrid military elite blending Chinese and steppe traditions
- **Key point**: Ethnicity was fluid; intermarriage created a powerful new ruling class

### 3. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #1** (3 minutes):
Think-Pair-Share: Why might a mixed ethnic background have been an advantage for reunifying China? Discuss with a partner what this tells us about identity in this period.

### 4. **Sui Reunification Campaign** (12 minutes):
- Naval power key to defeating Southern Dynasties (589 CE)
- Built massive fleet with multi-deck warships holding 800 men each
- 518,000 troops deployed along Yangzi River
- Captured Nanjing within three months, forcing southern elites to relocate north
- **Unification strategy**: Combined military force with cultural integration

### 5. **Sui Institutional Foundations** (8 minutes):
- Wendi strengthened central government control over local officials
- Returned to Han-style examination system (abandoning Nine Rank System)
- **Grand Canal construction**: Massive infrastructure project linking north and south
- Buddhism as legitimizing ideology (Wendi as Cakravartin king)
- **Five revisions of Tang legal code** established lasting framework

### 6. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #2** (3 minutes):
Quick Write: The Grand Canal required massive conscripted labor. What were the trade-offs between grand imperial projects and the welfare of common people?

### 7. **Sui Overreach and Collapse** (7 minutes):
- Yangdi's failed Korean campaigns (598, 611, 613, 614)
- Massive mobilization exhausted the empire
- 1.1 million combat troops claimed for 612 campaign
- Drought, floods, epidemics combined with war exhaustion
- Rebellion and banditry by 615; dynasty collapses by 618

### 8. **Wrap-up** (3 minutes):
The Sui accomplished reunification but couldn't sustain it. Next lecture: How did the Tang learn from Sui mistakes and build a dynasty that would last nearly 300 years?

**Big Question**: What does the Sui Dynasty's brief but consequential reign teach us about the relationship between military power, institutional reform, and imperial stability?
