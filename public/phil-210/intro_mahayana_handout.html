        <h2>I. Historical and Philosophical Emergence</h2>
        <p>Mahayana Buddhism (Sanskrit: <em>Mahāyāna</em>, "Great Vehicle") crystallized between 100 BCE and 100 CE. It represents a significant shift in Buddhist orthopraxy and soteriology. While earlier traditions (often grouped as <em>Theravada</em> or <em>Nikaya</em>) emphasized individual liberation and the attainment of the Arhat state, Mahayana expanded the scope of the Dharma to include the liberation of all sentient beings.</p>
        
        <h3>The Shift from Arhat to Bodhisattva</h3>
        <p>In early Buddhism, the <strong>Arhat</strong> was the ideal: a practitioner who had extinguished the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion to achieve Nirvana. Mahayana critiqued this as a "lesser" or "solitary" goal. Instead, it proposed the <strong>Bodhisattva</strong> ideal—a being who, through <em>Bodhicitta</em> (the awakening mind), vows to attain full Buddhahood but remains within the cycle of Samsara to assist others.</p>

        <h2>III. Canonical Literature (Sutras)</h2>
        <p>Mahayana identifies a vast corpus of scriptures believed to be the "second turning of the wheel of Dharma."</p>
        
        <h3>1. Prajnaparamita (Perfection of Wisdom)</h3>
        <p>The <em>Heart Sutra</em> and <em>Diamond Sutra</em> are central to this category. They deconstruct the categories of early Buddhist psychology (the <em>skandhas</em>) to reveal <strong>Shunyata</strong>. The famous dictum "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form" challenges the dualism between the material world and the absolute.</p>
        
        <h3>2. The Lotus Sutra (Saddharma Pundarika)</h3>
        <p>This text is foundational for East Asian Buddhism. It introduces the idea of the "One Vehicle" (<em>Ekayana</em>), asserting that all previous teachings were merely <em>Upaya</em> (skillful means) to prepare students for the ultimate truth of universal Buddhahood.</p>
        
        <h3>3. The Vimalakirti Sutra</h3>
        <p>Unique for its focus on a layperson (Vimalakirti) who surpasses ordained monks in wisdom, emphasizing that enlightenment is not restricted to the monastic elite.</p>

        <h2>IV. Major Traditions and Sects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zen (Chan):</strong> Emphasizes <em>Dhyana</em> (meditation) and direct transmission of mind over scriptural study. Focuses on "sudden" enlightenment (<em>Satori</em>).</li>
            <li><strong>Pure Land (Jodo Shu/Shinshu):</strong> A devotional path centered on Amitabha Buddha. Practitioners seek rebirth in the Western Pure Land (Sukhavati) through faith and the recitation of the <em>Nembutsu</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Vajrayana (Tibetan):</strong> Often called the "Diamond Vehicle," it utilizes esoteric rituals, mantras, and mandalas to achieve Buddhahood rapidly, potentially within a single lifetime.</li>
            <li><strong>Nichiren:</strong> A Japanese tradition emphasizing the <em>Lotus Sutra</em>. Practitioners chant <em>Nam Myoho Renge Kyo</em> to manifest their inherent Buddha-nature and impact social reality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>V. The Parable of the Burning House</h2>
        <div class="important-note">
            <p><strong>Source:</strong> <em>The Lotus Sutra</em>, Chapter 3</p>
            <p>An elderly man's mansion catches fire while his children are playing inside, unaware of the danger. To lure them out, he promises them three types of carts: goat-carts, deer-carts, and ox-carts. When they emerge, he gives them all a single, magnificent, jewel-encrusted Great Ox Carriage.</p>
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The house represents <strong>Samsara</strong>. The fire represents <strong>suffering (dukkha)</strong>. The father is the <strong>Buddha</strong>. The three carts are the <strong>preliminary teachings</strong> (Skillful Means), and the Great Ox Carriage is the <strong>Mahayana path</strong>—the ultimate truth intended for everyone.</p>

        <p><em>Discussion Question: If "emptiness" (Shunyata) implies that nothing has a permanent self, how can Mahayana also argue for an inherent "Buddha-nature" (Tathagatagarbha) in all beings? Are these concepts contradictory or complementary?</em></p>
