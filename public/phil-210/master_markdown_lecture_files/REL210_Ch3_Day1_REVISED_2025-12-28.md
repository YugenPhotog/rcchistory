## Annotated Instructor Prep Bibliography (REL 210 — Hinduism; Chapter 3 Days 1–3)

> Purpose: Instructor-facing prep to support lectures on (1) early South Asian religious history, (2) Vedic → Upanishadic concepts (dharma/karma/samsara/moksha; Brahman/Atman; yoga paths), (3) bhakti and major deities, (4) Bhagavad Gita, and (5) caste + modern/global Hinduism.

### Essential Foundation Texts

**Flood, Gavin. _An Introduction to Hinduism_. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996.** A classic "big map" introduction that stays conceptually clear while still respecting complexity. Best for calibrating your core vocabulary (dharma, karma, moksha) and keeping the tradition's diversity in view without collapsing it into a single "belief system."  
**Best for:** Day 1–3 (overall spine).

**Michaels, Axel. _Hinduism: Past and Present_. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2004.** Excellent for moving beyond abstractions to "how Hinduism works" socially and ritually, while still giving historical structure. Particularly useful if you want to add more lived-practice texture (pūjā, ritual life, institutions).  
**Best for:** Day 1–2 (practice + history integration).

**Knott, Kim. _Hinduism: A Very Short Introduction_. 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016.** Compact, highly teachable refresher with good handling of modern issues (diaspora, politics, contemporary diversity). Perfect for "I teach this tomorrow" recalibration.  
**Best for:** Day 3 (modernity) and quick pre-class refresh.

**Baltutis, Michael C. _What Is Hinduism?: A Student's Introduction_. London/New York: Routledge, 2024.** A newer, explicitly student-oriented synthesis that anticipates beginner confusions (definitions, diversity, "Hinduism" as a category). Useful for tightening phrasing and picking examples that land with first-years.  
**Best for:** Day 1–3 (pedagogical phrasing and examples).

---

### Use-Critically Enrichment

**Doniger, Wendy. _The Hindus: An Alternative History_. New York: Penguin, 2009.** A sweeping narrative that foregrounds voices and materials often minimized (women, sexuality, popular practice, marginalized groups). Useful for broadening instincts—but treat as one interpretive lens and triangulate with other overviews.  
**Best for:** Day 2–3 (myth, diversity, counterweight to overly Brahman-centered storytelling).

**Doniger, Wendy. _On Hinduism_. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014.** Essay collection: great for quick deep-dives into polytheism, mythology, gender, and interpretive problems.  
**Best for:** Day 2–3 (conceptual clarifications; examples).

---

### Primary Sources (Translations)

**Olivelle, Patrick (trans.). _Upaniṣads_. Oxford World's Classics. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996.** A dependable scholarly translation with notes that help you explain Brahman/Atman, metaphysical vocabulary, and the shift from ritual maintenance to liberation inquiry.  
**Best for:** Day 2 (Upanishads; Brahman/Atman; moksha).

**Miller, Barbara Stoler (trans.). _The Bhagavad-Gita: Krishna's Counsel in Time of War_. New York: Bantam, 1986.** Readable, poetic, and classroom-friendly. Useful for preparing a clean explanation of karma yoga, nonattachment, and the text's rhetorical strategy.  
**Best for:** Day 3 (Gita; karma yoga; gunas; self).

**Easwaran, Eknath (trans.). _The Bhagavad Gita_. 2nd ed. Tomales, CA: Nilgiri Press, 2007.** A devotional-leaning translation with an accessible voice; helpful as a contrast if you want to discuss how translation tone reflects interpretive stance.  
**Best for:** Day 3 (comparative "how translations shape meaning").

---

### Caste, Politics, and Contemporary Issues

**Teltumbde, Anand. _The Persistence of Caste_. New Delhi: Navayana, 2010.** Hard-hitting, contemporary analysis by a Dalit activist-scholar. Excellent for grounding caste discussion in lived realities and modern violence/structures.  
**Best for:** Day 1–3 (caste context; modern stakes; discussion framing).

**Yengde, Suraj. _Caste Matters_. New Delhi: Penguin Random House India, 2019.** Readable, contemporary framing of caste as a living system—not a relic. Useful for anticipating student objections/misconceptions.  
**Best for:** Day 1 + Day 3 (caste + modernity).

**Narayan, Badri. _Republic of Hindutva_. New Delhi: Penguin Viking, 2021.** A focused guide to contemporary Hindutva's institutional and political influence.  
**Best for:** Day 3 (contemporary applications; careful political framing).

**Hansen, Thomas Blom, and Srirupa Roy (eds.). _Saffron Republic_. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2022.** An academic, multi-author collection that situates Hindutva within state power and media ecosystems.  
**Best for:** Day 3 (instructor depth; nuance).

---

### Gender, Diaspora, and Archaeology

**Pintchman, Tracy (ed.). _Women's Lives, Women's Rituals in the Hindu Tradition_. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007.** Ethnographically oriented and useful for correcting male-centered narratives.  
**Best for:** Day 2–3 (bhakti/practice; ritual life beyond texts).

**Hawley, John Stratton, and Vasudha Narayanan (eds.). _The Life of Hinduism_. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006.** A superb "lived religion" reader—excellent for reminding yourself how diverse practices look on the ground.  
**Best for:** Day 2–3 (practice, devotion, ritual diversity).

**Jacobsen, Knut A. (ed.). _Hindu Diasporas_. Oxford University Press, 2023.** A major, up-to-date scholarly collection on global Hindu communities.  
**Best for:** Day 3 (global Hinduism; diaspora; contemporary issues).

**Kenoyer, Jonathan Mark. _Ancient Cities of the Indus Valley Civilization_. Karachi: Oxford University Press, 1998.** Foundational overview of Indus material culture and urban life.  
**Best for:** Day 1 (Indus; material culture; cautious inference).

**Narayanan, Vasudha. _Hinduism_. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004.** A concise, academically reputable overview useful as a quick cross-check against purely "outsider" summaries.  
**Best for:** Day 1–3 (fast cross-check; voice balance).

# SLIDE 1
## Hinduism – Basic Orientation

- The foundational elements of Vedic religion—the precursor to Hinduism—arrived with Indo-Aryan migrations (c. 1500–1200 BCE) into the Indus River Valley.

# SLIDE 2
## Hinduism: A Functional Definition

- **The "Umbrella" of Indian Traditions:** Hinduism is the indigenous social and religious system of the Indian subcontinent—a **"family of traditions"** sharing a common history rather than a single creed.
- **Demographics:** Practiced by **over one billion** people; the world's third-largest religion.
- **Internal Diversity:** Encompasses monotheism, polytheism, and even atheism under one cultural framework.
- **No Single Founder:** Unlike Buddhism or Christianity, it has no historical founder or specific "start date."
- **No Central Authority:** No universal "statement of faith" and no hierarchy comparable to a Pope.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Start by challenging the students' preconceptions of what a "religion" must look like. Use the definition to ground the lecture: it is a "family of traditions." Use the analogy of "Western Philosophy"—it is a long, related conversation rather than a single set of rules.

---

# SLIDE 3
## Common Threads and Social Structure

- **The Vedas:** Ancient Sanskrit scriptures (c. 1500–1200 BCE) that serve as a symbolic, foundational authority.
- **Dharma:** The central focus on **orthopraxy** (right action/duty) over orthodoxy (right belief).
- **Social Nature:** Historically a **non-missionary** religion; identity is traditionally tied to family, social class, and the Indian subcontinent.
- **Key Concepts:** Unified by a shared vocabulary of **Karma** (action/consequence) and **Samsara** (the cycle of rebirth).

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Emphasize that in Hinduism, *what you do* (Dharma) is often more important than *what you believe*. Explain that identity is deeply rooted in the social fabric of India.

---

# SLIDE 4
## Geography and the Name "Hindu"

- **Geographical Origin:** The term *Hindu* was originally an **exonym** (a name given by outsiders).
- **Linguistic Evolution:**
    1. **Sindhu:** The Sanskrit name for the Indus River.
    2. **Hindu:** The Persian pronunciation (c. 500 BCE) for those living across the river.
    3. **Indos/India:** The Greek/Latin variations of the same root.
- **The "Ism":** "Hinduism" was codified as a discrete category by 18th-century colonial administrators and 19th-century reformers.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Trace the geography: Sindhu (Sanskrit) → Hindu (Persian) → Indus (Greek). Explain that "Hinduism" is an umbrella term imposed from the outside that was later embraced by practitioners.

---

# SLIDE 5
## The Hindu Present as Shaped by Its Past

**Key Historical Periods:**
1. Indus Valley/Dravidian (3000-1500 BCE)
2. Vedic Period (1500-600 BCE)
3. Upanishadic Period (600-400 BCE)
4. Classical Period (400 BCE-600 CE)
5. Devotional Period (600 CE-Present)

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Use this to shift from definitions to deep history. Draw a timeline on the board.

---

# SLIDE 6
## Indus Valley Civilization (ca. 3000–1500 BCE)

- **Urban Sophistication:** Planned cities such as **Harappa** and **Mohenjo-Daro** featuring indoor plumbing and standardized weights.
- **Identity & Language:** Inhabitants likely spoke **Dravidian** languages; genomic data shows a population distinct from later Indo-Aryan groups.
- **Chronology:** Reached urban peak c. 2600 BCE.
- **Systemic Collapse:** Likely driven by **environmental shifts** (tectonic changes and river desiccation) rather than military conquest.

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Map of Indus Valley civilization sites]

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Contrast the "Environmental Collapse" with the older, discredited "Aryan Invasion" theory. Remind students "Dravidian" refers to a language family and cultural group.

---

# SLIDE 7
## Inhabitants and Legacies: Harappans vs. Dravidians

- **The Harappans:** The archaeological name for the IVC inhabitants; urban traders, not nomadic warriors.
- **The Dravidian Connection:**
    - "Dravidian" refers to a family of **80 living languages** (like Tamil and Telugu).
    - Scholarly Consensus: Harappans likely spoke a **Proto-Dravidian** tongue.
- **The Great Migration:** When cities collapsed (c. 1900 BCE), the population shifted south.
- **The Result:** Modern South Indian culture preserves many linguistic and religious elements of the original IVC.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Clarify that "Dravidian" isn't a race—it's a language family. This explains why Hinduism feels different in the North (Vedic influenced) vs. the South (Dravidian influenced).

---

# SLIDE 8
## Harappan Religion: Material Inferences

Scholars rely on **material culture** to reconstruct belief systems:

- **Ritual Spaces:** The **Great Bath** at Mohenjo-Daro suggests a focus on **ritual purification** and communal water rites.
- **Iconography:** Terracotta figurines suggest veneration of **Mother Goddesses**.
- **Nature and Fertility:** Evidence of tree worship (pipal tree) and animal veneration (bulls/unicorns) indicates roots in environmental cycles.
- **The Shakti Antecedent:** Likely represents early roots of **Shakti** (divine feminine power) and **Prakriti** (nature).

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Emphasize the **Great Bath** as the strongest evidence for ritual purity (orthopraxy) pre-dating the Vedas.

# SLIDE 9
## The Pashupati Seal: A "Proto-Shiva"?

| Feature | Archaeological Observation | Historiographical Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Posture** | Seated figure with heels pressed together. | Early form of **Yoga** (Mulabandhasana). |
| **Headdress** | Large, prominent buffalo horns. | Power over nature or a "horned deity." |
| **Surroundings** | Encircled by an elephant, tiger, rhino, and buffalo. | **Pashupati** (Lord of the Animals), an epithet of Shiva. |
| **Anatomy** | Often described as ithyphallic (erect). | Symbol of fertility and the ascetic power of the *Lingam*. |

**SPEAKER NOTES:** This seal suggests Hinduism was a **synthesis**. While the Vedas brought the *gods*, the IVC may have provided the *practices* (Yoga, meditation).

---

# SLIDE 10
## Artifacts: Leadership and Aesthetics

| Artifact | Religious & Social Significance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Priest-King" Figure** | Debated status; suggests an elite or religious leadership role despite a lack of palaces. |
| **"Dancing Girl" Bronze** | Suggests a focus on ritual dance, specialized craftsmanship, and indigenous aesthetics. |

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** These figures represent the mystery of Harappan power structures, as archaeology hasn't found evidence of monarchs.

---

# SLIDE 11
## Artifacts: Feminine and Fertility

| Artifact | Religious & Social Significance |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mother Goddesses** | Clay figurines found in homes suggest domestic worship of divine feminine power. |
| **"Venus" Figurines** | Shared motifs with other ancient cultures focusing on agricultural and human fertility. |

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** These suggest the roots of later Hindu **Shaktism** (worship of the Goddess) may have originated in domestic IVC rituals.

---

# SLIDE 12
## [ASSESSMENT_BREAK] Quick Check: Early Foundations

**DISCUSSION_PROMPT:** Based on archaeological evidence alone, what religious themes appear in Indus Valley civilization? How do these compare with other ancient civilizations you've studied?

**Think-Pair-Share Activity:**
1. Individual reflection (2 min)
2. Partner discussion (3 min)
3. Class sharing (5 min)

---

# SLIDE 13
## Indo-European Languages and Indo-Aryan Migration

- **Indo-European:** A language family that spread across Eurasia.
- **Indo-Aryan Branch:** Connected to northwest South Asia in the 2nd millennium BCE (c. 2000–1000 BCE).
- **Interaction:** Groups interacted with existing South Asian communities; languages and cultures **mixed and changed** over time.
- **Linguistic Evidence:** Earliest Vedic texts are Indo-Aryan, while southern languages (Dravidian) remain prominent.

[WARNING_BOX: "Aryan" here is a linguistic/cultural term. It is NOT the racist Nazi misuse of the word.]

---

# SLIDE 14
## The Vedic Period (ca. 1500–600 BCE)

- **The Vedas:** Derived from Sanskrit *vid* ("to know"); earliest sacred "wisdom" texts.
- **Oral Tradition:** Transmitted orally with mathematical precision long before being written.
- **The Rig Veda:** Oldest of the four (c. 1400–900 BCE); 1,028 hymns to nature deities.
- **Core Components:**
    - **Hymns (Samhitas):** Praises to deities like Indra and Agni.
    - **Sacrificial Focus:** Centered on *Yajna* (fire sacrifice) to maintain *Rta* (cosmic order).

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Vedic religion was **portable**. Because they were nomadic, their "temple" was the fire altar. This precision elevated the **Brahmin** (priest) class.

---

# SLIDE 15
## The Indo-Aryan and Harappan Synthesis

- **Chronology Check:** Cities were abandoned c. 1900 BCE due to environmental shifts. Indo-Aryans arrived c. 1500 BCE.
- **The Reality:** Migrants did not "topple" an empire; they settled alongside remnants of de-urbanized populations.
- **The Dāsa:** The Vedas refer to outsiders as *Dāsa*. They were likely local groups with different religious rites.
- **Fusion:** Synthesis of Vedic ritual and Harappan yoga/fertility motifs formed the bedrock of Hinduism.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Frame this as a migration and cultural collision rather than a conquest. Local people provided practices like yoga and goddess worship.

---

# SLIDE 16
## The Vedic Caste System (Varna)

- **Social Ideal:** A fourfold social ideal called **varna** ("class/order") takes shape in late Vedic texts.
- **Varna ("Color"):** Best treated as a **symbolic/classificatory** term; the skin-color/racial theory is **discredited**.
- **Traditional Structure (Rig Veda 10.90):**
    - **Brahmin:** Priests (mouth).
    - **Kshatriya:** Rulers/Warriors (arms).
    - **Vaishya:** Merchants/Commoners (thighs).
    - **Shudra:** Servants/Laborers (feet).

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Varna is an **idealized ranking model** in elite texts, not a census of lived reality. It later interacted with **jati** (local birth-based groups).

---

# SLIDE 17
## The Hymn of the Cosmic Man (Purusha Sukta)

- **The Primal Sacrifice:** Universe created through the ritual sacrifice of **Purusha**, a primeval giant.
- **Social Blueprint:** Portrays *Varnas* as organic, divinely ordained parts of a single cosmic body.
- **Divine Hierarchy:** The priests speak (mouth), warriors protect (arms), producers support (thighs), and servants provide the foundation (feet).

img placeholder *Figure: A traditional manuscript of the Rig Veda illustrating the cosmogonic process of Purusha's sacrifice.*

---

# SLIDE 18
## Varna and Dalits

- **Dalits ("Oppressed Ones"):** Historically **outside** the fourfold varna system.
- **Ritual Pollution:** Performed tasks like butchery, tanning, and cleaning latrines considered polluting in traditional society.
- **Hereditary Status:** Led to deep social discrimination and untouchability.
- **Terminology:** Gandhi called them **Harijan** ("children of God"), but many find the term patronizing.

**DISCUSSION_PROMPT:** What do you think the appeal of the caste system was for it to last thousands of years? Why are reformers trying to dismantle it today?

---

# SLIDE 19
## Jati – Birth Group

- **Definition:** *Jati* means "birth"; these are the thousands of local birth-based groups people actually belong to.
- **Function:** Often tied to clan, tribe, or occupation.
- **Expectations:** Marry within the jati and follow occupational/social patterns of the birth group.
- **Lived Reality:** In practice, one's *jati* is more important than the abstract *varna*.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Mention contemporary legal bans on caste discrimination in India and the ongoing realities of inequality.

---

# SLIDE 20
## Vedic Religion (Vedism): Sacrifice and the Gods

- **Influencing Divine Forces:** Gods play a crucial role; sacrifice strengthens deities who in turn sustain the cosmos.
- **Sacred Time:** Sacrifice re-creates sacred time and maintains cosmic order.
- **Rituals:** Included chanted hymns, drinking of **soma** (sacred drink), and animal sacrifice.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Ask students to compare Vedic sacrifice with sacrifice in other ancient religions (Greek, Israelite, etc.).

---

# SLIDE 21
## Major Vedic Deities: Indra and Agni

- **Indra:** King of the gods; wielding the **thunderbolt** and bringing rain. A warrior god strengthened by offerings of soma.
- **Agni:** God of **fire**; fire of the sun, lightning, and hearth. **Carries sacrifices** from humans to the gods. Central to rituals like **Agnihotra**.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** These gods reflect both natural forces and social needs (victory in war, communication with the divine).

---

# SLIDE 22
## Agnihotra Ritual and the Rishi

- **Agnihotra:** Daily fire ritual performed by the head of the household to carry offerings to deities like Varuna and Brahma.
- **Rishi ("Seer"):** A person who directly experiences divine reality, often through altered states of consciousness (sometimes linked to soma).
- **Social Shift:** Over time, power concentrated in **Brahmin** priests, leading to a sacrificial cult dominated by elites.

[POPUP: rishi - A "seer" who directly experiences divine reality]

---

# SLIDE 23
## Historical Transitions: Setting the Stage

- **Growing Dissatisfaction:** Developing critique of external ritual and questions about ultimate reality.
- **Philosophical Revolution:** Contact with concepts of rebirth set the stage for the Upanishads.

**Preview: Next Class**
- The Upanishadic revolution.
- Core concepts: Brahman, Atman, Karma, Samsara.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Use this as a bridge to Day 2, emphasizing how traditions evolve through internal critique and external challenge.

---

# SLIDE 24
## [ASSESSMENT_BREAK] Day 1 Synthesis

**Exit Ticket Questions:**
1. Name three key differences between Dravidian and Vedic religious elements.
2. How did the caste system develop from the interaction of these cultures?
3. What role did sacrifice play in Vedic religion?

**Homework:** Read selections from the Rig Veda and identify one hymn to a deity and one reference to social order.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Today we traced dual roots in IVC and Vedic cultures through the development of caste. Next class: the philosophical revolution!
