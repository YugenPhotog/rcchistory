# Man’s Inhumanity to Man  
## And the Problem of Human Evil  

---  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> This lecture situates the Holocaust within a wider history of genocides and mass atrocities. Emphasize both continuity (humans have done horrific things in many contexts) and specificity (each case has its own causes, targets, and mechanisms). Keep the tone sober and analytical, not sensational.

# Century of Genocide – Unbearable Consequences  

- Holocaust Studies often focuses on the **Jewish Holocaust** alone.  
- This can create two problematic assumptions:  
  1. The Holocaust was **sui generis** – totally unique and an aberration in history and human nature.  
  2. Other atrocities (especially Communist and some fascist crimes) are minimized or ignored.  
- There was never a **“Nuremberg Trial”** for Communist atrocities:  
  - No systematic punishment of perpetrators.  
  - No global discrediting of radical left-wing ideology.  
- Many left-wing ideologues continued to enjoy respected positions in Western societies and universities even after mass atrocities were known.  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Clarify that this is not a “whataboutism” to downplay the Holocaust, but a call to see it alongside other 20th‑century horrors. Encourage students to compare *scale, intent, ideology,* and *methods* across cases.

# The Holocaust (Shoah)  

## Jewish Holocaust in Modern Europe  

- Long **Jewish Diaspora** comes into conflict with rising **European nationalism**.  
- This tension produces what contemporaries call **“The Jewish Question.”**  
  - Hundreds of pamphlets, articles, and books propose “solutions.”  
- By the late **19th century**, the Jewish Question takes on an openly **antisemitic** tone.  
- Growing calls for legislation to **“de‑Jewify”**:  
  - The press  
  - Education  
  - Culture  
  - The economy  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Stress the gradual evolution: social prejudice → political antisemitism → state-sponsored exclusion → genocide. It did not “come out of nowhere” in 1933 or 1941.

---  

## The “Final Solution” to the Jewish Question  

Key mechanisms of the Nazi program:  

- **Ghettos**  
  - Forced segregation of Jews into walled districts with severe overcrowding and starvation.  

- **Mobile Killing Squads (Einsatzgruppen)**  
  - Followed advancing armies into Eastern Europe.  
  - Conducted mass shootings, especially of Jews, Roma, and political commissars.  

- **Killing Centers (Extermination Camps)**  
  - Purpose-built sites such as Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec, Chelmno.  
  - Industrialized mass murder using gas chambers, forced labor to death, starvation, disease.  

### Jewish Holocaust – Death Toll  

- Approximate Jewish death toll: **6 million**.  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Explain the distinction between **concentration camps**, **labor camps**, and **extermination camps**. If students have read *Night* or watched *Schindler’s List*, connect those narratives to this structure.

---  

## “Night and Fog” – Film Clip  

- Recommended documentary/film segment: **Night and Fog** (*Nuit et Brouillard*).  
- Uses archival footage to document Nazi camps and aftermath.  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Prepare students before showing any graphic content. Emphasize why visual evidence matters and discuss ethical viewing: bearing witness vs. voyeurism.

# Armenian Genocide  

## Background  

- **Ottoman Empire’s attempted genocide** of its ethnic Christian Armenian population during and after **World War I**.  
- Armenians viewed with suspicion as a potentially disloyal minority aligned with foreign Christian powers (Russia, Western Europe).  

## Stages of Destruction  

- Begins with wholesale killing of **able-bodied Armenian males** through:  
  - Massacres  
  - Forced labor battalions  
- Followed by **mass deportation** of women, children, and the elderly on **death marches**:  
  - Deprived of food and water  
  - Subjected to rape and massacre  

### Methods of Mass Killing  

- Massacres included:  
  - **Burnings**  
  - **Drownings**  
  - Killings by doctors (e.g., poison, medical abuse)  

### Visual Evidence (Slides)  

- Armenians marched to prison.  
- Corpses of massacred Armenians.  
- Armenian woman kneeling by her dead child.  

### Armenian Genocide – Death Toll  

- Estimated Armenian death toll: **~1.5 million**.  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Connect to ongoing political debates over naming this as “genocide.” Ask why states sometimes resist acknowledging genocides, and what is at stake in the label.

# Communist Atrocities – 20th Century  

## Major Episodes  

- **The Red Terror** (early Bolshevik period).  
- **The Gulag** – extensive system of forced labor camps.  
- **The Great Terror / Great Purge** (Stalin’s purges of the 1930s).  
- **Ukrainian Famine (Holodomor)** – man-made famine in early 1930s.  
- **Communist Genocide in Cambodia** under the Khmer Rouge.  

### Approximate Death Tolls  

- **USSR (Soviet Union)**:  
  - Estimated **20 million** deaths under Communist rule from executions, famine, forced labor, and related causes.  
- **Cambodia (Khmer Rouge)**:  
  - Estimated **2 million** deaths, about **20%** of the total population.  
- Approximate **total deaths directly related to Communist regimes in the 20th century**:  
  - Often estimated around **100 million** (including USSR, China, Cambodia, and other contexts).  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Stress the difficulty of precise numbers and the range of scholarly estimates. The key point: these are *massive* crimes against humanity, not isolated excesses.

---  

## The Red Terror and the Gulag  

- **Red Terror**: early campaign of arrests, executions, and repression following Bolshevik Revolution.  
- **Gulag**: network of labor camps for political prisoners and “enemies of the people.”  
- Prisoners subjected to:  
  - Forced labor in extreme climates.  
  - Starvation, disease, and violence.  

### Example: Pavel Florensky  

- Philosopher and theologian **Pavel Florensky** arrested and sent to the Gulag.  
- After three years, taken to the woods and shot.  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Use Florensky as a micro‑history: a single person whose fate illustrates systems of repression.

---  

## Ukrainian Famine (Holodomor)  

- Artificial famine in **Ukraine** (and other grain regions) linked to forced collectivization and state requisition of grain.  
- Millions die of starvation.  
- Images show:  
  - Emaciated bodies.  
  - Mass graves.  
  - Rural devastation.  

### USSR – Overall Toll  

- Estimated **20 million** people killed in the USSR through:  
  - Purges  
  - Executions  
  - Forced labor  
  - Famine and related policies  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Ask why famine caused by policy should be classed alongside direct mass killing. Explore the concept of **“politicide”** or destruction of perceived political enemies.

---  

## Killing Fields of Cambodia  

- Under **Pol Pot** and the **Khmer Rouge**, Cambodia experiences radical agrarian Communism.  
- City dwellers forced into the countryside as laborers.  
- Mass executions at designated **killing fields**.  
- Total deaths: about **2 million**, roughly **20%** of the population.  

### Visual Slides  

- Photographs of skulls, mass graves, and memorial stupas.  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Talk about ideological purity and utopian promises: how do these justify exterminating “class enemies” or “parasites” in the minds of perpetrators?

---  

## Total Communist Atrocities – 20th Century  

- Combined death toll often estimated at **around 100 million**.  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Place this alongside Nazi crimes without collapsing the differences. Invite comparison of:  
> - Racial vs class-based targets  
> - Industrial vs agrarian methods  
> - Role of ideology and bureaucracy in both systems.

# Japanese Fascist Atrocities – World War II  

## Rape of Nanking (Nanjing Massacre)  

- **Rampage of ~7 weeks** (1937–1938).  
- Brutal **murder and rape** by invading Japanese troops.  
- Estimated **200,000–300,000** Chinese civilians and prisoners of war murdered.  
- Estimated **20,000–80,000** women raped.  
- Creation of an **International Safety Zone** by foreign residents to protect civilians (partial success).  

### Comfort Women System  

- Institution of forced sexual slavery (“**comfort women**”) across Japanese-occupied territories.  
- Women and girls from Korea, China, the Philippines, and other regions forced into military brothels.  

### Unit 731  

- Secret Japanese military unit conducting **biological and medical experiments** on prisoners.  
- Experiments included:  
  - Deliberate infection with plague and other diseases.  
  - Vivisection and extreme cruelty.  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Encourage students to compare Allied postwar responses: Nuremberg and Tokyo Trials. Ask what accountability looked like and where it fell short.

# Homo hominī lupus est – “Man is a Wolf to Man”  

## Man’s Inhumanity to Man and Human Nature  

- Latin phrase **“Homo hominī lupus est”**: “Man is a wolf to man.”  
- Raises the question: **What is human nature?**  

Key claims:  

- Human nature is fundamentally **the same and universal**.  
- Human beings are born **good and innocent, but “encumbered.”**  
- Humans have **moral agency** and can choose good or evil.  
- Our ability:  
  - To **think** (inner dialogue).  
  - To **choose**.  
  - To act on those choices → shapes our character.  
- **Monsters or saints are made, not born.**  
- “The wrench in the works” of human goodness is **human evil** – the choices we make.  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Invite discussion: do students agree that we are born good and become evil or saintly through choices? Compare to other views (original sin, blank slate, sociobiology, etc.).

---  

# Radical Evil – Immanuel Kant  

## Pathologizing Evil vs Radical Evil  

- Many try to understand evil by **medicalizing** or **psychologizing** it (e.g., mental illness).  
- Kant argues that for some actions, **“evil” is the only adequate explanation**.  
- This kind of evil is **unfathomable** in ordinary moral categories.  
- Kant calls it **“radical evil.”**  

### Kant’s Account of Radical Evil  

- Failure of moral agents to obey the **moral law** is **symptom** of a deeper **corruption of character**.  
- There is an **innate propensity to evil**:  
  - To subordinate the moral law to **self-conceit** (undue pride in oneself).  
- Because this propensity **corrupts the entire character**, and is the **innate source** of other evil deeds, it can be called **“radical.”**  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Clarify that “innate propensity” does not mean people are compelled to do evil; rather, there is a basic tendency that can be either resisted or indulged.

---  

## Radical Evil – Summary Slide  

- Some want to understand evil by pathologizing it.  
- That may explain some cases, but in others **sheer evil choice** seems the only explanation.  
- This kind of evil is **extreme and hard to comprehend**.  
- **Consistent evil choices** have a **transformative effect**:  
  - Evil choices **shape** and **create** an evil character or nature.  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Ask students whether they think character can become so deformed that change is nearly impossible—without claiming it is literally impossible.

# Extreme Evil and the Banality of Evil – Hannah Arendt  

## Extreme Evil / Crimes Against Humanity  

- Atrocities committed by totalitarian regimes on a huge scale **necessarily involve**:  
  - The actions and support of many **otherwise ordinary people**.  
  - People “just like us.”  
- This **can and must be understood**; it is not magic or demonic possession.  

## Banality of Evil  

- Arendt’s concept after observing the trial of **Adolf Eichmann**.  
- Eichmann was **not** the monstrous villain she expected, but:  
  - A **mindless bureaucrat**.  
  - Proud of his loyalty to Hitler.  
  - Proud of his efficiency in “just following orders.”  
- A man who helped send **millions of Jews to their deaths** without personal hatred toward them.  
- Most people responsible for atrocities were **unthinking bureaucrats or soldiers**.  
- There are also **radically evil individuals** who exploit the system to inflict cruelty.  
- But large-scale atrocities happen when **most people do not or cannot think and choose the good**.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Ask students to consider small ways in which people “stop thinking” in ordinary life (groupthink, peer pressure, bureaucracy). Connect to Milgram experiment or Stanford prison study if appropriate.

# Superfluous Human in Totalitarianism  

## Dehumanization in Totalitarian Regimes  

- In totalitarianism (fascist or communist), the **human as a human being becomes superfluous**.  
- This applies to:  
  - Victims.  
  - Perpetrators.  
- Totalitarianism seeks to eliminate:  
  - **Spontaneity**  
  - **Creativity**  
  - **Individuality**  
- It **dehumanizes everyone**.  

### Arendt’s Analysis (Origins of Totalitarianism, p. 457)  

- Totalitarianism does not merely seek **despotic rule over people**.  
- It aims at a system in which people become like **marionettes**, reduced to:  
  - Conditioned reflexes.  
  - “Specimens of the animal-species man.”  
- People are taught they are **superfluous** through a way of life where:  
  - Punishment has no clear relation to crime.  
  - Exploitation occurs without rational profit.  
  - Work is performed without meaningful product.  

## Living Corpses  

- Totalitarian ideologies create **“living corpses”**:  
  - People who have **lost the ability to think** as moral agents.  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Use this to discuss modern threats to personhood: propaganda, surveillance, dehumanizing language. Ask: where do we see people treated as superfluous today?

---  

# Inability to Think – Arendt’s Concept  

## What Does It Mean “To Think”?  

For Arendt, **“to think”** means something specific:  

- An **inner dialogue with the self**.  
- A constant asking of questions like:  
  - “Is this action right?”  
  - “Does this action put my self‑interest above the needs and rights of others?”  

Totalitarianism aims to:  

- Change human nature into one that **no longer has the ability to think and judge** between right and wrong.  
- Reduce people to **functionaries who simply serve the state**.  

> **Key Quote:**  
> “Good can be radical; evil can never be radical, it can only be extreme, for it possesses neither depth nor any demonic dimension yet—and this is its horror—it can spread like a fungus over the surface of the earth and lay waste the entire world. **Evil comes from a failure to think.**”  
> — Hannah Arendt, *Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil*  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Have students journal briefly: “Describe a time when you failed to ‘think’ morally and just went along. What would real thinking have looked like?”

---  

# Prevention – Education and Moral Responsibility  

## Banality of Evil and Superfluous Humans  

- **Superfluous humans without the ability to think** lead to the **banality of evil**.  
- Systems that shut down genuine thinking make atrocities more likely.  

## Role of Education  

- **Education is key**, but:  
  - Not **education for its own sake**.  
  - Highly educated people (e.g., **Dr. Josef Mengele**, **Dr. Shiro Ishii**) have committed horrific crimes.  
- We need **education that teaches people to think**:  
  - Critical thinking.  
  - Moral reasoning.  
  - Courage to make difficult ethical choices.  

### A Free and Thinking Society  

- A just society requires citizens who:  
  - Have both the **ability** and **freedom** to think.  
  - Have the **courage to act** on moral judgments.  
- Warning:  
  - Societies can “**slouch**” toward systems where:  
    - **Identity politics** or other ideologies trump the value of individual rights.  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Encourage students to connect this to contemporary debates in education and politics—but keep discussion grounded in evidence and respectful disagreement.

---  

# Memory, History, and Moral Action  

- “If memory and history are not used for a better future, but only to re‑enact the hostilities of a bad past, then none of us is doing our job.”  
- **Moral imperative of remembrance**:  
  - Study past atrocities to **prevent** new ones.  
  - Use history to cultivate empathy, vigilance, and courage.  

> **Famous Warning (often attributed to Edmund Burke):**  
> “All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people do nothing.”  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Close by asking: What concrete forms can “doing something” take in ordinary life? Link back to Arendt’s insistence that evil spreads when thinking and judgment stop.
