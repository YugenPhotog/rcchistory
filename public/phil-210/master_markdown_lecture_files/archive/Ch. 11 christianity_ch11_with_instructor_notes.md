# Christianity
## Chapter 11

---

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> This lecture tracks Christianity from its origins as a Jewish renewal movement to a global, internally diverse religion. Keep connecting each historical shift to changes in power, doctrine, and practice.

## Names: Christianity

- Daughter religion to Judaism  
- “Judeo-Christianity” / Christianity  
- Religion based on Jesus Christ’s life and teaching  
- Jesus of Nazareth as central figure  
- **Shared Beliefs with Judaism:** one God, Hebrew Scriptures, covenant language  
- **Distinguishing Features:**  
  - Jesus as Messiah (Hebrew) / Christ (Greek) – the Anointed One  
  - Christian liberty / salvation in Christ

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Emphasize continuity *and* rupture with Judaism. Students often assume total break; highlight early Jesus movement as Jewish.

---

# The Christian Present as Shaped by Its Past

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Use this phrase to frame why church history matters: modern doctrines, denominations, and disputes come out of these earlier struggles.

---

# The Life, Death, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ
*(ca. 4 BCE – 30 CE)*

- Primary sources: the four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John)  
- Birth around 4 BCE; death ca. 29–30 CE  
- Public ministry begins with baptism  
- Calls twelve disciples, later known as apostles  
- Travels through Judea teaching and performing miracles  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Remind students that the Gospels are theological narratives, not modern biographies. Historians reconstruct cautiously.

---

## Sermon on the Mount & Beatitudes

- “Blessed are…” statements (Matt 5:3–12)  
- Their character and privileges (vv. 3–12)  
- Their responsibilities as “salt” and “light” (vv. 13–16)  
- Counter-cultural values  
- “Kingdom ethics” – blueprint for Christian living  

### Matthew’s Antitheses: The Higher Law

- “You have heard it said… but I say to you…”  
- Law reinterpreted from external behavior to inner motives  
- Fulfillment of the Law (Matt 5:17)  
- Call to higher moral and spiritual standard  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Show how ethical emphasis shifts inward (intention, motive) rather than just outward rule-keeping.

---

## Parables

- Jesus “did not speak to them without a parable” (Mark 4:34)  
- Greek root: “comparison,” set side by side  
- Short narratives and metaphors that demand interpretation  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Have students interpret one short parable in groups to experience the “work” of interpretation.

---

## The Command to Love

- Primary message centered on love (Matt 22:36–40)  
  - Love God (Deut 6:5)  
  - Love neighbor (Lev 19:18)  
- Radically new applications:  
  - Turn the other cheek (Matt 5:39)  
  - Love your enemies (Matt 5:44)  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Contrast “love your enemies” with common honor/shame or retaliation ethics in antiquity.

---

# The Passion and Resurrection

- Entry into Jerusalem at Passover → crisis point  
- Last Supper with disciples  
- Betrayal by Judas Iscariot  
- Arrest, trial, and suffering (“Passion”)  
- Condemned before Pilate (Matt 27:1–2, 11–25)  
- Scourged and crucified (Matt 27:26–50)  
- Laid in tomb (Matt 27:57–60)  
- Resurrection (John 20:3–18)  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Explain “Passion” = suffering. Use the sequence of Gospel texts as a narrative spine.

---

# Christology

- Branch of Christian theology dealing with the person, nature, and role of Jesus Christ  

### Divine and Human Nature

- **Hypostatic Union:** Jesus fully divine and fully human  
- **Incarnation:** God becomes human in Jesus Christ  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Students don’t need to master the terms, but they should grasp that early debates centered on *who* Jesus is.

---

# Titles of Christ

- Christ (Greek) / Messiah (Hebrew) – “Anointed One”  
- King of the Jews / spiritual king with royal lineage  
- **Savior** – saves his people from their sins (Matt 1:21)  
  - Sin = willful disobedience of God’s commandments  
  - Sin cuts humans off from God  
  - Savior needed to justify (pardon, clear from guilt)  

- Savior of all – extends salvation beyond ethnic Israel  
- Son of God – divine sonship central to Christianity  
  - Luke 1:35 – child called Son of God  
- “I AM” – Johannine language linking Jesus to divine name (“Before Abraham was, I am.”)

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Connect these titles to Jewish expectations (Messiah, Son of David) and how Christians universalize them.

---

# Work of Jesus – Soteriology

- **Soteriology:** theology of salvation  
- Jesus identifies as Messiah (Luke 4:18–21; Mark 14:61–62)  
- **Atonement:** reconciliation of God and humanity through Christ  
- Passion (suffering and death)  
  - Gethsemane (Luke 22:44)  
  - Crucifixion  
  - Resurrection  

### Christus Victor

- Jesus’ death and resurrection as victory over sin, death, and the devil  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Briefly name that other atonement theories exist (penal substitution, moral influence, etc.) but don’t go deep unless this is a theology class.

---

## From Jesus Movement to Universal Religion

- Early followers: Jewish “Jesus movement” inside Judaism  
- After resurrection, apostles commanded to teach Gentiles (Matt 28:19 vs. Matt 10:5–6)  
- Atonement extended to all who believe, repent, and are baptized  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Stress the shift from intra-Jewish sect to Gentile-inclusive religion.

---

# Earliest Church (ca. 33–90 CE)

- Emerges within Roman Empire  
- House churches, shared meals, local leadership  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Contrast flexibility of early house churches with later institution-building.

---

# Ancient Period (100–500 CE)

## Growth of the Church

- Apostles die without formal succession plan  
- Christian communities across eastern Roman Empire  
- Local leadership:  
  - **Episkopos** (overseer / bishop)  
  - **Presbyter** (elder)  
- No single authority yet for whole church  
- Growth provokes Roman suspicion, persecution, martyrdom  
- Persecutions fail to destroy movement  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Introduce term “martyr” and how persecution shaped Christian identity.

---

# Constantine and Christianization

- Constantine emperor 306–337  
- 312: Vision “In this sign, you will conquer”  
- 313: Edict of Milan – toleration and imperial support  
- Christianity becomes favored, then state religion  
- Desire for **“One God, one Church, one Emperor”**  
- Need for unified doctrine (orthodoxy)

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Ask what happens when a persecuted minority becomes aligned with imperial power.

---

# Creation of Orthodoxy

- 325: Council of Nicaea – first ecumenical council  
- Goal: unify worldwide church; produce Nicene Creed (revised 381)  
- Creeds define correct teaching (orthodoxy)  
- Alternative theories labeled **heresy** and may be punished  
- Heresy becomes both religious and political crime  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Important nuance: Many “heretics” thought they were defending biblical truth.

---

## Ongoing Councils and Christological Debates

- Multiple councils refine creedal language  
- Many disputed theories focus on Christology (who Jesus is, how divine/human works)  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Don’t drown students in names—emphasize that doctrine emerges through conflict and compromise.

---

# Major Christian “Heresies” (Competing Theologies)

## Arianism

- Arius: Jesus is “begotten,” therefore not fully God in same sense as Father  
- Jesus and God are of *like* substance, not the same substance  
- Denies full divinity of Christ  
- Brief ascendancy, then condemned

## Monophysitism

- “One nature” – Christ has only one nature (fully divine or fully human)  

## Docetism

- From Greek *dokein* – “to seem”  
- Jesus only appeared to have a real human body  
- Often linked with Gnosticism (matter evil, spirit good; salvation via secret knowledge)  

## Monarchianism

- Strong emphasis on unity of God  
- **Adoptionism** – Jesus a miraculously born man adopted by God  
- **Patripassianism** (“Father suffers”) – Father himself appears and suffers as Son; Trinity seen as modes of a single divine being  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> You don’t need every nuance tested; focus on how each position “protects” some aspect of God/Christ but creates new problems.

---

# Nicene Creed

- Developed in councils to respond to such theories  
- Key phrases directly target them, e.g.:  
  - “Begotten, not made, of one being with the Father” → against Arianism  
  - “Was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became truly human” → against Docetism  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Activity idea: have students match creed phrases to the heresies they counter.

---

# St Augustine (354–430)

- Hugely influential Western theologian  
- Writings shaped medieval and later Christianity  
- Major works:  
  - *Confessions*  
  - *City of God* (response to sack of Rome)  
- Key ideas:  
  - Original Sin  
  - Divine Grace  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> If time, draw a line from Augustine’s views to later Protestant–Catholic debates.

---

# Monasticism

- St Benedict (480–547), “father of Western Monasticism”  
- Hermit reputation → founded monastery  
- **Rule of Benedict** provides detailed life guidelines  
- Monastic prayer and chant (Gregorian chant)  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Stress monasteries as centers of learning, copying manuscripts, and social service.

---

# Byzantine, Medieval, and Renaissance Christianity (500–1500 CE)

## Eastern Orthodox Developments

- Constantine moves capital to Constantinople  
- Western empire falls; Eastern (Byzantine) continues for 1000+ years  
- Bishop of Constantinople = *primus inter pares* (“first among equals”)  
- Western church shaped by Latin; Eastern by Greek  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Clarify that Orthodoxy and Catholicism share early creeds but diverge institutionally and culturally.

---

# Iconoclasm Controversy

- Emperor Leo III orders destruction of icons (in part reacting to Muslim criticism)  
- Pope and Western church defend images  
- Eastern councils denounce icons as idolatry; later **Second Council of Nicaea** affirms their use  
- Deepens East–West tensions  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Use this to explore how images function in worship and identity.

---

# Filioque Controversy and the Great Schism

- Western church adds *filioque* (“and the Son”) to creed about Spirit’s procession  
- Eastern bishops reject the addition  
- 1054: mutual excommunications between Pope and Patriarch  
- Schism between Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches becomes lasting  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Emphasize both theology and politics in the split.

---

# Reformation in the Western Church (1500–1600)

## Corruption and Critique

- Church wealthy, powerful, entangled with feudal monarchies  
- Land ownership, tithes, forced labor (corvée), Papal States  
- Land rich but cash poor  
- 1517: Pope Leo X offers indulgences to fund rebuilding of St Peter’s  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Be explicit: corruption + spiritual anxiety created fertile ground for reform.

---

## Indulgences

- Indulgence = remission of temporal / purgatorial punishment for sins  
- Sold for money → scandal and abuse  

---

## Reformers Before Luther

- John Wycliffe (1330–1384), English theologian  
  - Promoted Bible translation into English  
  - Criticized church wealth and doctrines such as transubstantiation  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Present Wycliffe as proto-Reformer; not yet a full break but cracks forming.

---

# Martin Luther

- German monk from wealthy family  
- Abandons law for monastery after thunderstorm vow  
- Doctor of Theology (1512), professor of Bible  
- Objected to indulgence preaching  
- 1517: posts **95 Theses** at Wittenberg, challenging both abuse and doctrine of indulgences  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Clarify that Luther didn’t initially aim to split the church; he sought academic debate.

---

# Luther’s New Theology

- **Sola gratia** – salvation by grace alone  
- **Sola fide** – justification by faith alone, not works  
- **Sola scriptura** – Scripture alone as ultimate authority  

### Challenge to Catholic Sacramental System

- Catholic view: sacraments as means of grace administered only by ordained priests  
- Luther: rejects magisterium’s exclusive authority  
- Promotes “priesthood of all believers”  
- Limits sacraments to two: Baptism and Eucharist  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Link these principles to later Protestant denominations (Bible focus, preaching, reduced sacramentalism).

---

# The Lutheran Church

- Luther excommunicated in 1521  
- Movement forms new evangelical churches  
- Supported by several German princes  
- Bible translated into German  
- Congregational singing expanded (e.g., “A Mighty Fortress Is Our God”)  

---

# Floodgates Open: Other Reformers

- John Calvin  
- Huldrych Zwingli  
- Anglican Reformation (Church of England)  
- Anabaptists  
- Over time: an estimated tens of thousands of denominations globally  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> You don’t need the exact number on tests; emphasize fragmentation and diversity.

---

# Catholic Counter-Reformation

- Catholic efforts to reform internally and answer Protestant critiques  
- Pope Paul III convenes **Council of Trent** (1545)  

### Council of Trent Outcomes

- Doctrinal clarifications (including transubstantiation)  
- Affirmation of sacraments and church authority  
- Discipline and reform (abuses, education)  
- Index of Forbidden Books  
- New religious orders, especially **Society of Jesus (Jesuits)**  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Stress that Trent reaffirms Catholic distinctives, not a compromise council.

---

# Society of Jesus (Jesuits)

- Founded 1534 by Ignatius of Loyola  
- Vow of loyalty to Pope  
- “Shock troops” of Counter-Reformation  
- Known for rigorous education and scholarship  
- Major role in global missions (e.g., Francis Xavier in Asia)  

---

# Roman Inquisition

- Established 1542 by Pope Paul III  
- Aim: maintain orthodoxy, combat Protestantism and heresy  
- Under Holy Office; run by cardinals and officials  
- Methods: interrogation, sometimes torture; censorship and book control  
- Tried figures like Giordano Bruno and Galileo  
- Significant impact on intellectual life and scientific development  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Use this to open questions about faith, authority, and inquiry.

---

# Modern Christianity (1900–Present)

## Fundamentalism

- Reaction against liberalizing theology and biblical criticism  
- Emphasizes:  
  - Biblical inerrancy  
  - Virgin birth  
  - Physical resurrection  
  - Atonement  
  - Imminent Second Coming  
- Opposition to evolution in schools boosts movement in 1920s  
- Creates Bible institutes and colleges; heavy use of radio/TV preaching  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Stress that “fundamentalist” has both historical meaning and modern pejorative use; define historically.

---

## Ecumenism

- Movement for unity and cooperation among churches  
- Changes:  
  - New ways theologians talk about doctrine  
  - New relationships among churches  
  - New grassroots worship/collaboration  
- After WWII: **World Council of Churches (WCC)** founded  
- Since Vatican II: renewed Catholic engagement; lifting of some mutual excommunications  

---

# Second Vatican Council (1962–1965)

- 21st ecumenical council of Roman Catholic Church  
- Signals willingness to engage modern world  

Key changes:

- Greater lay involvement  
- More open biblical scholarship  
- Use of vernacular languages in Mass instead of Latin  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Show “before and after” examples (Latin vs vernacular liturgy).

---

# Common Teachings and the Trinity

## Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed

- Key statement of belief for Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, many Protestants  
- Articulates doctrine of Trinity  
- God the Father and Jesus Christ as “consubstantial” (same substance)  
- Further developed in Athanasian Creed  

## Doctrine of the Trinity

- Term “Trinity” not in the New Testament, doctrine emerges later  
- Early Christians wrestle with: one God + Father + Son + Spirit  
- 4th–5th centuries: creeds codify “one God in three persons, one substance”  
- Aim:  
  - Maintain monotheism  
  - Distinguish Christianity from pagan ideas  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Make clear the difference between biblical language and later doctrinal formulation.

---

# Persons of the Trinity

## God the Father

- All-powerful, creator, personal and relational God  

## God the Son

- Involved in creation  
- Crucified and exalted Lord  
- New Testament Gospels give differing portraits, but one Christ  

## God the Holy Spirit

- Called “Lord” and “giver of life”  
- Proceeds from Father (and, in Western creeds, “and the Son”)  
- Inspires prophets, empowers believers  
- Described as powerful and unpredictable  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> You can connect Spirit theology to charismatic movements later in the lecture.

---

# Ethical Foundations

- Strongly shaped by Pauline epistles  
- Draw on Ten Commandments  
- Emphasize:  
  - Trust in God  
  - Hope in God’s future  
  - Inner peace  
  - Love for all people  
- Ethics grounded in life, death, and resurrection of Jesus  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Highlight how ethics are Christ-centered rather than merely rule-based.

---

# Christian Worship and Ritual

- Earliest believers: worship in Jerusalem temple and synagogues  
- Catholic Church later organizes around seven sacraments  
- Eastern Orthodox unifies worship across branches  
- Reformation, Catholic reforms, and Vatican II reshape worship to be more “of the people” (active participation)  

## Development of Worship Forms

- After Christianity is legalized:  
  - Larger church buildings  
  - Formal clerical vestments modeled on Roman official dress  
  - Liturgical calendar established  
- House-church intimacy replaced by more formal liturgy  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Ask students what is gained and lost in this shift.

---

# Other Worship Practices

## Cult of the Saints

- Veneration at shrines, churches, and sacred places  

## Eucharistic Diversity

- Different liturgies in various regions  

## Protestant Approaches

- Emphasis on preaching Scripture  
- Sacraments usually reduced to Baptism and Holy Communion  
- Worship conducted in vernacular languages  

## Charismatic and Pentecostal Movements

- Stress supernatural gifts of the Holy Spirit  
- **Charismatic** groups inside Catholic, Orthodox, and mainline Protestant churches  
- **Pentecostal** churches where charismatic practices are central  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Use this to show the range of worship styles within modern Christianity—from highly liturgical to highly spontaneous.

---

# Closing Reflection

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> End by tying together three threads:  
> 1. How questions about *who Jesus is* shaped doctrine.  
> 2. How questions about *authority* shaped institutions.  
> 3. How questions about *holiness and ethics* shaped everyday Christian life.
