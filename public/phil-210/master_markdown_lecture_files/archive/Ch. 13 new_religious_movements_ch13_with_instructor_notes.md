# New Religious Movements
## Chapter 13

---

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> This chapter works best if you combine history, sociology, and theology. Keep reminding students that “new” religious movements are someone’s sacred story, and that academic study doesn’t equal either endorsement or rejection.

# New Religious Movements and Their Other Names

## What Are New Religious Movements?

- **New Religious Movements (NRMs)**  
  - Arose in modern times.  
  - Have sufficient size, longevity, and impact to merit academic study.

## Other Labels (and Their Problems)

- **Sect**  
  - A new and relatively small group that has emerged from an established or larger religion.

- **Cult**  
  - A religious group that is seen as extreme in its dedication to its beliefs.  
  - **Not an academic term**; often used as an insult for groups outside the mainstream.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Make a big deal out of the word “cult” being polemical, not neutral. Encourage students to use “NRM” or “movement” in class discussion.

---

# Common Doctrines in NRMs

- **Apocalyptic**  
  - Belief that the world will end soon and be replaced by a perfect or transformed society.

- **Millenarianism**  
  - Belief in a thousand-year reign of peace on earth near the end of time.

- **New Age**  
  - Eclectic beliefs and practices.  
  - Aim to bring the individual to a state of higher consciousness or spiritual awakening.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Give at least one concrete example for each category (e.g., Millerites/Adventists for apocalyptic, some New Age healing circles, etc.).

---

# Significant NRMs in the United States

- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS / Mormonism)  
- Seventh-day Adventists  
- Jehovah’s Witnesses  
- Scientology

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Clarify that only some of these are viewed as “controversial” in popular culture, but all fit the NRM pattern historically.

---

# Religion in the Jacksonian Age

- Democratization of religion.  
- Separation of church and state widens space for new groups.  
- Emphasis on appeal to **ordinary people**.  
- “Plain words from the heart” rather than elaborate theology.  
- Rejection of strong Calvinist predestination; focus on **individual choice and destiny**.  
- Period of intense religious revival and experimentation.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Connect this to broader Jacksonian themes: expanding suffrage, suspicion of elites, frontier culture.

---

# The Second Great Awakening (1790s–1830s)

- Period of intense religious revival.  
- Characterized by **camp meetings**.  
- Camp meeting revivals emphasized:  
  - Intensely personal religious experience.  
  - Sudden conversion (“getting saved”).  
- Many new movements and denominations were organized from this revivalist energy.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Help students see that the same environment that produces new denominations also produces NRMs—lots of fluidity and innovation.

---

# Three Rules of Religious Understanding (Krister Stendahl)

1. When trying to understand another religion, **ask the adherents** of that religion, not its enemies.  
2. Don’t compare **your best** to **their worst**.  
3. Leave room for **“holy envy”** – recognize elements in other religions that you admire or wish could be reflected in your own tradition.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> You can adopt these as ground rules for the whole course. They are especially helpful when discussing contested NRMs like Mormonism and Scientology.

---

# The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormonism)

## Joseph Smith and the Rise of Mormonism

### Joseph Smith: Early Life

- Born 1805 into a poor farming family in Vermont.  
- Family forced to sell farm after a failed business deal.  
- 1816: Smith family moves to **Palmyra, New York**.  
- Lives by manual labor; Joseph has **little formal education**.  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Emphasize Smith’s marginal social status—poor, little schooling, frontier context—contrasting with the sophistication of the movement that arises.

---

## The First Vision

- As a young teen, Joseph is caught in the crosscurrents of revivals in western New York (“Burned-over District”).  
- Troubled about religion, he reads: “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God…”  
- Prays for guidance → reports a visionary experience (the **First Vision**).  
- Claims to see divine personages who tell him existing churches are in error and he should not join any of them.  

### Significance of the First Vision

Central to LDS theology; LDS is a Christian sect but with significant differences from other Christian churches:

- **Nature of the Godhead**  
  - Godhead is three separate, distinct personages (Father, Son, Holy Ghost).  
  - Rejection of classical doctrine of the **Trinity**.

- **Apostasy and Restoration**  
  - Historic Christian creeds and churches seen as products of a **Great Apostasy**.  
  - Joseph Smith called as prophet to restore the “true” Church.

- **Continuing Revelation**  
  - Rejection of a **closed canon**; God can and does reveal new scripture and guidance.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Be precise: Latter-day Saints see themselves as Christian but believe that they restore original Christianity. Many other Christians dispute this; present it descriptively, not as a debate to settle in class.

---

### Theophany

- **Theophany** = visible manifestation or appearance of a deity.  
- The First Vision is understood by Latter-day Saints as a theophany.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Good vocabulary moment—help students distinguish “vision,” “revelation,” and “theophany.”

---

## Angel Moroni and the Gold Plates

- Turning point in 1823: Joseph prays at night, troubled by his sins.  
- He experiences a vision of a personage in brilliant light.  
- The figure identifies himself as **Moroni**, a resurrected being.  
- Moroni speaks of a record written on plates, buried in a nearby hill.  
- Plates contain the religious history of ancient peoples in the Americas.  
- Joseph is eventually commanded to retrieve and translate them.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Make clear that the gold plates themselves are no longer available; this is central to debates about historicity.

---

## The Book of Mormon

- First uniquely American scripture produced by a Christian NRM.  
- Structured similarly to the Bible (books and chapters).  
- Martin Harris called it the “Mormon Bible”; critics called it the “Gold Bible.”  
- Claims to record roughly **1,000 years** of primarily religious history in the Western Hemisphere.  
- Narrates:  
  - Wars and the fall of civilizations.  
  - Rise of prophets and reformers.  
  - Conversions and apostasies.  
  - A visit of the resurrected **Jesus Christ** to the Americas.

### Christian Message of the Book of Mormon

- Strongly Christ-centered; anchors Mormonism to Christianity.  
- Many doctrinal innovations, yet retains core Christian themes of:  
  - Faith in Christ.  
  - Repentance.  
  - Grace.  

A representative passage:

> “Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind, and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ…”

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Invite students to read excerpts, not summaries, so they can see why believers find it spiritually compelling regardless of their views on historical claims.

---

## Organizing the Church

- After publication of the Book of Mormon, the **Church of Christ** is organized in **Fayette, New York, April 6, 1830** (later Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints).  
- Persecution begins quickly; Joseph Smith charged with disorderly conduct and acquitted.  
- Highly active proselytizing church:  
  - Many male converts sent out as missionaries.  
- **Sidney Rigdon**, a Campbellite minister in Kirtland, Ohio, converts and brings ~100 members with him.  
- Smith moves Church headquarters to **Kirtland, Ohio**.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Link to broader American themes: religious entrepreneurship, voluntary associations, and frontier charisma.

---

## City of Zion and the Gathering

- Independence, Missouri, identified as the **City of Zion**.  
- Converts encouraged to gather to **Kirtland** or **Independence**.  
- Highlights Mormonism’s connection to:  
  - Founding actual cities.  
  - Exercising civic power.  

### Purposes of Gathering

- Prepare for the **Second Coming of Christ**.  
- Establish a righteous community.  
- Build temples for sacred ordinances.  

- **Kirtland Temple** is constructed as the first LDS temple.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Compare “gathering” to other utopian or communitarian experiments in 19th‑century America.

---

# Anti-Mormon Pogroms and Violence

- Plans to build Zion repeatedly thwarted by violence.  
- Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon **tarred and feathered** in 1833.  
- In Jackson County, Missouri, Mormons suffer:  
  - Tar and feathers, whippings.  
  - Crops burned, roofs destroyed.  
  - Cabins burned and cattle driven off.  
- Mormons flee to Clay County, then again to more remote areas in northern Missouri.

### “Pogrom” Defined

- **Pogrom**: mob attack, condoned by authorities, against persons and property of a religious, racial, or national minority.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Stress that persecution and violence are part of this story. Avoid simple “Mormons good / enemies bad” narratives; acknowledge complex local tensions.

---

## Mormon War, 1838

- With little legal protection, some Mormons organize the **Danites**, a group formed to defend property and expel dissenters.  
- Tensions escalate into open conflict known as the **Mormon War of 1838**.  
- Missouri governor **Lilburn Boggs** issues the infamous **“Extermination Order”**:  
  > “The Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State if necessary for the public peace…”

### Haun’s Mill Massacre

- October 30, 1838: armed Missourians attack the Mormon settlement at **Haun’s Mill**.  
- The community is unprepared; attackers kill those who cannot escape.  
- Seventeen people are killed, including children.  
- Mormons are forced to flee the state of Missouri.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Use this as an example of how religious minorities can be violently targeted, and how governments sometimes participate.

---

# Nauvoo Period

- Mormons welcomed by people of Illinois.  
- Found the city of **Nauvoo** on swampy land along the Mississippi River.  
- 1840: Nauvoo chartered by state government, with:  
  - Home rule.  
  - Local militia.  
- Joseph Smith serves as **mayor** and **militia leader**.  
- Within four years, Nauvoo grows to nearly the size of Chicago.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Ask students to think about how rapid demographic and political change might alarm neighboring communities.

---

## Polygamy (Plural Marriage)

- Smith begins introducing **polygamy** quietly during Nauvoo period.  
- At first **not openly taught**; rumors spread and create division.  
- Emma Smith (Joseph’s wife) is at times ambivalent, at times strongly opposed.  
- Joseph takes multiple wives; some relationships are non-conjugal.  
- After migration to Utah, polygamy is openly taught and practiced.  
- Long conflict with U.S. federal government over polygamy.  
- Officially discontinued in **1890** (LDS Church issues a Manifesto).

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Present polygamy neutrally but clearly; distinguish between past LDS practice, present LDS teaching, and splinter groups that continue it.

---

## Martyrdom of Joseph Smith

- Disaffected Mormons publish an anti-Mormon newspaper, the **Nauvoo Expositor**.  
- Nauvoo city council orders the press destroyed.  
- Joseph Smith is arrested and taken to **Carthage Jail** to face charges.  
- While in jail, Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum are shot and killed by a mob.  
- No one is convicted for the killings.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Emphasize both the violence of the mob and Joseph’s controversial use of civic power; it’s a collision of religious authority and American legal norms.

---

# Pioneer Era and the Westward Movement

## Brigham Young and the Trek West

- After Smith’s death, **Brigham Young** is chosen as successor and regarded as a prophet.  
- Organizes the **trek to Utah Territory** and colonizes the mountain West.  
- An estimated **80,000 pioneers** travel by wagon or on foot before railroads.  
- Utah Territory acquired by the United States in 1848.  
- Brings LDS Church into conflict with the U.S. government over polygamy and governance.

### Utah War (1857–1858)

- President **James Buchanan** dispatches federal troops to Utah in 1857.  
- Partly motivated by national politics, including debates over slavery and federal authority.  
- At height of tensions, the **Mountain Meadows Massacre** occurs in Sept. 1857, when a group of local Mormon militia and allies kill a large emigrant party.

### Textbook Errors to Note

- Brigham Young was the first **territorial** governor of Utah, but he was **not** the first **state** governor.  
- The Mountain Meadows Massacre was **part of** the Utah War context, **not** its cause.

### Aftermath

- Mormonism continues to grow following the Utah War.  
- Population increases through both natural growth and missionary conversion.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> This is a sensitive and complicated story. Acknowledge LDS and non-LDS scholarship on Mountain Meadows; emphasize historiographical complexity, not simple blame narratives.

# Distinctive Teachings of the LDS Church

- Christian denomination, but with important distinctions from mainstream Protestant and Catholic doctrines.

## Articles of Faith (Selected Themes)

- **(1)** Rejects traditional creedal concept of the **Trinity**; affirms three distinct divine personages.  
- **(2)** Rejects doctrine of **original sin** in its classic Western form.  
- **(3)** Emphasizes salvation by **grace and works together**.  
- **(6)** Teaches **apostasy and restoration** of the Church through Joseph Smith.

  - Baptism for the dead.  
  - Endowment ceremony.  
  - Sealing of families.  
  - Sacred temple clothing.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Clarify that only certain members in good standing participate in temple rites; most LDS meetings occur in regular meetinghouses, not temples.

---

# Anti-Mormonism

- Writings and media that seek to **“expose,” ridicule, or disprove** Mormon teachings and practices.  
- Stems from:  
  - Cultural, political, and economic tensions in the 19th century.  
  - Disaffected former Mormons.  
  - Non-Mormons offended by LDS doctrines or by the Church’s success.  
- Many critical sources mix fact, rumor, and polemic.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Remind students of Stendahl’s rules:  
> - Let believers define their own faith.  
> - Don’t compare your best to someone else’s worst.  
> - Allow for “holy envy.”  
> Encourage them to seek out LDS self-descriptions as well as neutral scholarship.

# The Church of Scientology

## Origins and Basic Ideas

- Psychologically oriented NRM founded by **L. Ron Hubbard** in the 1950s.  
- Early teachings introduced through books:  
  - *The Original Thesis*  
  - *Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health*  
- Initially focused on understanding and treating **mental and emotional problems**.  
- Later broadened into a religion called **Scientology**.

### Core Ideas

- Goal of human existence: **survival and enjoyment** of the world.  
- Deeds and thought habits that enhance survival are good and produce pleasure.  
- Deeds that go against survival are destructive.  
- When the mind is not functioning well, the **“reactive mind”** takes over, causing irrational behavior and suffering.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Link this to mid‑20th‑century self-help culture and popular psychology. Many students will be familiar with Scientology from media; keep focus on doctrine and structure, not celebrity gossip.

---

## Dianetics, Engrams, and Auditing

- **Engram**:  
  - Image or imprint of a past experience stored in the mind that hinders full functioning.  
- Hubbard’s goal:  
  - Help people identify and resolve their engrams.  
- **Auditing**:  
  - One-on-one counseling process.  
  - Auditor guides the person through memories to locate and clear engrams.  
- **E-meter**:  
  - Electronic device used during auditing.  
  - Intended to help identify areas of emotional charge associated with engrams.  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Compare this, cautiously, to forms of therapy—but emphasize that Scientology treats it as a religious technology, not just talk therapy.

---

## Thetan, MEST, and Exteriorization

- **Thetan**:  
  - The true self of every person.  
  - A spiritual being distinct from the physical body.  
- Interaction of **thetans** gives rise to **MEST**:  
  - **MEST** = Matter, Energy, Space, Time – the physical universe that traps thetans.  
- **Exteriorization**:  
  - State in which a person senses their consciousness as leaving the body.  
  - Understood as a thetan becoming more aware of its independent existence.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Point out that Scientology cosmology presents humans as fundamentally immortal spiritual beings who have become trapped and confused.

---

## Operating Thetan (OT) Levels and Dynamics

- **Operating Thetan (OT) Levels**:  
  - Stages at which a Scientologist is considered to function as a fully conscious, highly capable thetan.  
  - Progression through graded levels of training and auditing.

- **Dynamics**:  
  - The drive for survival expressed through **eight dynamics** or spheres:  
    1. Self.  
    2. Family and sex.  
    3. Groups such as community and nation.  
    4. All humankind.  
    5. All living things including animals.  
    6. The physical universe (MEST).  
    7. Spiritual beings.  
    8. Infinity or God.  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> This is a helpful diagram moment—students often grasp the eight dynamics more easily visually.

---

## Organization of the Church of Scientology

### Central Organizations

- **Flag Service Organization**  
  - Society of highly dedicated church members established by Hubbard.  
  - Headquarters in **Clearwater, Florida**.  
  - Provides advanced training for the highest OT levels.

- **Sea Organization (Sea Org)**  
  - Group of full-time church workers.  
  - Assist national and local Scientology organizations.  
  - Known for strict discipline and long-term commitment.

### Local Churches and Governance

- Scientology functions through local churches with a **business-like structure**.  
- Administered by the **Church of Scientology International (CSI)**.  
- **Religious Technology Center (RTC)** holds final authority over the use of Scientology’s trademarks and “religious technology.”  
- In 2012, the church announces a program to transform local churches into **Ideal Organizations (“Ideal Orgs”)** with upgraded facilities and standardized design.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Highlight how strongly structured and centralized Scientology is compared to many other NRMs.

---

## Controversies Surrounding Scientology

- **Medical Criticisms**  
  - Physicians and psychiatrists have charged that **Dianetics** amounts to practicing medicine without a license.

- **Government Scrutiny**  
  - Scientology has been subject to investigations and legal battles with various governments.

- **Former Members’ Allegations**  
  - Claim deceptive financial practices.  
  - Report harassment of journalists, critics, and those who try to leave the church.  

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> This is a good place to revisit Stendahl’s rules. Encourage students to distinguish between:  
> - Academic description of beliefs and practices.  
> - Legal and ethical critiques.  
> - Sensationalized media narratives.

---

# Closing Reflection on NRMs

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Wrap up the chapter by asking:  
> - Why do new religious movements arise at particular moments in history?  
> - How do social, political, and economic pressures shape their formation and reception?  
> - How can we study groups we might personally find strange—or even troubling—with fairness, rigor, and “holy envy” where appropriate?
