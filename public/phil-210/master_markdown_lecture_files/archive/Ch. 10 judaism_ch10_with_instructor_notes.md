# Encountering Judaism
## Chapter Ten

---

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> This chapter works well as both history and theology. Keep circling back to how “being Jewish” involves peoplehood, land, covenant, law, and ethics. Stress that “myth” here is an academic term for sacred story, not “false story.”

# The Name “Judaism” and Related Terms

## Judaism

- Historic religion of the people variously known as:  
  - **Hebrews**  
  - **Israelites**  
  - **Jews**  
- Descendants of the patriarchs of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament):  
  - Abraham  
  - Isaac  
  - Jacob (also called **Israel**).  
- Judaism is an example of an **ethnic religion**:  
  - Tied to a particular people as well as a religious tradition.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Make sure students see that “Jewish” can refer to religion, ethnicity, culture, or all three. Ask them why that complicates simple categories like “religion” vs “people.”

---

# The Jewish Present as Shaped by Its Past

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Use this heading to frame the rest of the lecture: contemporary Jewish life is unintelligible without covenant, land, exile, Torah, and persecution.

# From the Creation to Abraham (ca. 2000 BCE)

## Creation Myths (Genesis 1–2)

- God referred to as **Elohim** and **YHWH Elohim**.  
- Six-day creation pattern:  
  - Light  
  - Waters and firmament  
  - Land and vegetation  
  - Sun, moon, stars  
  - Animals  
  - Humanity  
- Humanity created in **God’s image** (*Imago Dei*).  
- Establishment of **Sabbath** rest.

> **Note:** Using “myth” here does **not** mean “false.” It means sacred narrative about origins.

---

# The Great Flood: Divine Judgment and Mercy

- Humanity’s corruption leads to decision for a great flood.  
- **Noah** chosen because of his righteousness.  
- The flood functions as a **reset** of creation.  
- Noah and his family preserved in the ark.  
- Afterward, God establishes a **covenant with Noah**.  
- **Rainbow** given as sign of divine mercy and promise not to destroy the world by flood again.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Connect this story to covenant patterns and to ancient Near Eastern flood myths (if you have time).

---

# Covenant People

- **Genesis 17:7** – God promises to establish a covenant with Abram and his descendants.  
- History of Judaism begins with **Abram/Abraham** and God’s covenant.  
- “Covenant” literally means a **contract** or agreement.  
  - In the Bible: a two-way promise between God and His people.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Have students identify basic covenant elements: parties, terms, sign, promises, consequences.

---

## Chosen People

- **Deuteronomy 10:15** emphasizes divine choice:  
  - God “set His affection” on the ancestors.  
  - God “chose their descendants after them… above all peoples.”  
- “People” = Judaism is both a **religion and an ethnicity**.  
- **Chosenness** brings a **call to be holy**, not privilege without responsibility.  
- Idea of being chosen has helped Jews sustain their identity through a long and difficult history.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Ask: What are the possible dangers and gifts of believing you are “chosen”?

---

# Abrahamic Covenant

## The Call and Theophany

- **Genesis 17:1–2** – God appears to Abram and calls him into covenant.  
- **Theophany** = a visible manifestation of God to human beings.

## “Cutting” the Covenant

- **Genesis 15:9–10; Jeremiah 34:18** – covenant symbolized by cutting animals.  
- Ancient practice of “cutting” a covenant underscores its seriousness.

## Terms of the Covenant (Gen 17:1–8)

- Abraham and his descendants are to:  
  - Worship, believe, and obey God.  
  - Walk “before God” and be “blameless.”  
- God promises to:  
  - Be God to Abraham and his descendants.  
  - Give them the land where Abraham is a stranger.  
  - Make Abraham “father of many nations.”  
- Abram’s name changed to **Abraham** to mark new status.

## Token and Blessings of the Covenant (Gen 17:11–12)

- **Circumcision** of every male as sign of the covenant.  
- Blessings include:  
  - **Posterity** – exceedingly fruitful, nations and kings from him.  
  - **Land** – a homeland for his descendants.  
  - **Protection** – God as shield.  
  - **Universal blessing** – “in you and in your descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed.”

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Stress how covenant theology underlies later ideas about land, law, and messiah.

---

# Patriarchal Order

- Covenant passes **from father to son**.  
- **Patriarchal primogeniture** – the firstborn son normally inherits leadership.  
- Jacob’s twelve sons become ancestors of the **twelve tribes of Israel**.  
- Story of **Joseph** explains how the family ends up in Egypt.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Note that primogeniture is often subverted (Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over Esau), which is itself a theological statement.

---

# The Emergence of Ancient Israel (ca. 1200–950 BCE)

## Exodus and Enslavement in Egypt

- Book of **Exodus** narrates:  
  - Israel’s enslavement in Egypt.  
  - God’s call to **Moses** to lead them out.  
  - Pharaoh’s resistance.  
  - Escape through parted waters of the **Red Sea**.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Mention that the historicity of the Exodus is debated; emphasize what the story does theologically for Israel’s identity.

---

# Significance of the Exodus

The Exodus is absolutely central for understanding Jewish religious identity.

- **Unification** – forms a single people out of tribes.  
- **People creation** – Israel becomes a nation under God.  
- **Covenant relationship re-established** – God renews covenant at Sinai.  
- **Law of Moses instituted** – **Torah** given.  
- **Tabernacle (Tent-Temple)** constructed:  
  - Sacred space for Israelite worship.  
  - Houses the **Ark of the Covenant**.  
- Wilderness period **purges older generation** (including Moses) before entry into land.  
- Israel learns **utter dependence on God** for food, water, and guidance.  
- Monotheism reasserted and strengthened.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Connect Exodus themes to later Jewish holidays, especially Passover.

---

# The First Temple Period (ca. 952–586 BCE)

- After Moses, **Joshua** leads Israelites into **Canaan** (late 13th to early 12th c. BCE).  
- Land divided among tribes and initially ruled by **Judges**.  
- Later, Israelites adopt **monarchy**:  
  - Saul  
  - David  
  - Solomon  
- **Solomon** builds the first permanent **Temple** to replace the Tabernacle.  
- Temple centralizes worship in **Jerusalem**.

## Division of the Kingdom

- After Solomon’s death, kingdom divides:  
  - **Israel (North)** – ten tribes.  
  - **Judah (South)** – tribes of Judah and Benjamin.

## Assyrian Exile

- 722 BCE: **Assyrian Empire** conquers northern kingdom of Israel.  
- Population displaced and mixed with others (“Lost Ten Tribes”).  
- Kingdom of Judah survives as a **vassal state**, paying tribute.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Draw a simple map showing North/South split and emphasize how political events reshape religious life.

---

# The Second Temple Period (539 BCE–70 CE)

## Babylonian Captivity

- Prophet **Jeremiah** denounces sins of Judah and predicts destruction.  
- 586 BCE: **Babylon** besieges Jerusalem.  
  - First Temple destroyed.  
  - Many (but not all) Jews deported to Babylon.

## Persian Restoration

- 539 BCE: **Persians** conquer Babylon.  
- **Cyrus the Great** allows exiles to return and rebuild the Temple.  
- **Judah** becomes a province in the Persian Empire.  
- 515 BCE: **Second Temple** completed and rededicated.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Note continuity: despite exile, covenant peoplehood continues; identity shifts from land-centered to Torah-centered.

---

# Hellenistic and Hasmonean Periods in Judea

- 332 BCE: **Alexander the Great** conquers Judah → Greek control.  
- Hellenistic rulers introduce Greek culture and, at times, religious pressures.  
- **Maccabean Revolt** throws off Greek domination.  
- **Hasmonean dynasty** rules an independent Judea for about a century.  
- **Hanukkah** commemorates the rededication of the Temple after Maccabean victory.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Useful moment to talk about Hellenization and Jewish responses (accommodation vs resistance).

---

# Roman Period (63 BCE onward)

- 63 BCE: Rome intervenes and annexes Judea into the **Roman Empire**.  
- **Herodian Dynasty**:  
  - **Herod the Great** (37–4 BCE) rules as Roman client king.  
  - Known for massive building projects, including expansion of the Second Temple.  
- Tensions grow between Jewish population and Roman authorities.  
- **First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE)** erupts.

## Destruction of the Temple

- 70 CE: Romans destroy the **Second Temple**.  
- Two further major Jewish revolts attempt to regain independence; both are crushed.  
- 132–136 CE: Bar Kokhba revolt; Romans respond by:  
  - Renaming the province **Judea → Syria Palestina**.  
  - Turning Jerusalem into a Roman colony, **Aelia Capitolina**.  
  - Displacing large portions of the Jewish population.

> **Note:** Not all Jews leave the land. Jewish communities remain in Palestine continuously from antiquity to the present.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Emphasize Temple destruction as a massive theological crisis: no Temple, no sacrifices—Judaism must evolve.

---

# The Jewish Diaspora and the Origins of Antisemitism

## Jewish–Roman Wars and the Diaspora

- 63 BCE: Jerusalem captured by Romans.  
- 66 CE: First Jewish revolt.  
- 70 CE: Siege of Jerusalem and destruction of Second Temple.  
- 132–136 CE: Second major revolt; heavy losses of life and population.  
- Result: **Diaspora** – Jews scattered to many regions:  
  - Egypt, North Africa  
  - Iberian Peninsula  
  - Central Asia, etc.

**Diaspora**: Movement, migration, or scattering of a people away from ancestral homeland.

## Significance of the Diaspora

- Temple worship replaced by **synagogue**.  
- Authority of priests (Levites) replaced by **teachers (Rabbis)**.  
- Rabbis (successors of Pharisees) preserve a **lay-led** Judaism.  
- Rabbis become spiritual leaders in local synagogues.  
- Oral traditions written down; Judaism becomes **decentralized**.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Help students see synagogue-rabbi-Torah as the “portable” replacements for Temple-priest-sacrifice.

---

# Origins of Antisemitism (Brief Overview)

- In Diaspora, Jews often viewed as **outsiders**.  
- In agrarian societies, Jews frequently barred from landownership.  
- Many turn to non-farming occupations (trade, finance, crafts).  
- Become convenient **scapegoats** in times of crisis.  
- **Code of Justinian (527 CE)**:  
  - Contains discriminatory laws against Jews.  
  - Influences European legal systems for centuries.  
  - Contributes to institutionalized antisemitism.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Clarify: antisemitism has religious, economic, and social roots; it changes over time. You can link forward to medieval and modern antisemitism in later courses.

---

# Essential Jewish Teachings

Key doctrines include:

- **Monotheism**  
- **Covenant People**  
- **Hebrew Bible (Tanakh)**  
- **Ethical Monotheism**

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> This is a good transition from history into theology: what do Jews believe about God and their obligations?

---

# Ethical Monotheism

## Definitions

- **Monotheism**: belief in one and only one God.  
- **Ethical monotheism**: belief in one God who is the **source of morality** and who **demands goodness** (ethical conduct).

> “Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one!” (Deut 6:4)

### Key Implications

- God gives **moral obligations** to His people.  
- God is a **law-giver** who is not capricious or arbitrary.  
- **One God means one human race**:  
  - No person or group is intrinsically more valuable than any other.  
  - One moral standard for all people (universal morality).

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Ask students how this contrasts with ancient polytheism where different gods could endorse different moralities.

---

# Nature of Ethical Monotheism

## God is Transcendent

- “God created the heavens and the earth” (Gen 1:1).  
- God is **above and separate from nature**, not part of it.  
- Nature is finite; God is infinite.  
- God is **eternal and unchanging** (cf. Ps 102:25–27).  
- Nature is morally neutral; God is the **source of morality**.  
- Thus it is foolish to worship nature instead of the Creator (cf. Ps 96:4–5).

## God is Personal

- God **cares** about His creations.  
- Humans are created in God’s image with capacity to **know** and **relate** to God.

## God is Good

- God rules by moral standards; not arbitrary power.  

## God is Holy

- **Holy** = spiritually pure, consecrated, set apart.  
- Holiness lifts humans from animal drives to their “divine” calling as God’s image-bearers.  
- “Be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy” (Lev 19:2).

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> You can contrast this with gods in other mythologies who act immorally; here God *is* the moral standard.

---

# “Be Holy, For I Am Holy” – Holiness and Imitatio Dei

**Imitatio Dei** = imitation of God.

Rabbinic reflections:

- **Rashi** – links holiness to abstaining from sexual immorality and idolatry.  
- **Nahmanides (Ramban)** – holiness goes beyond avoiding forbidden acts; it requires positive ethical and moral behavior beyond legal minimum.  
- **Midrash** – “You shall be holy” is a comprehensive commandment from which many others flow; holiness permeates all religious observance.

**Holiness in Everyday Life**

- Radical idea: **every Jew**, not just priests, can be holy in daily actions.  
- Ethical behavior is intrinsic to the path of holiness.  
- Ritual, ethics, and spirituality are tightly intertwined.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Ask students to identify modern examples of “holiness in everyday life” (honesty in business, how you treat workers, etc.).

---

# Teachings of Judaism – The Jewish Canon

## Tanakh

- Name for the **Hebrew Bible**.  
- Acronym from:  
  - **Torah** (“instruction” or “law”)  
  - **Nevi’im** (“prophets”)  
  - **Ketuvim** (“writings”)  
- Canon finalized by the first century CE.  
- Viewed by traditional Jews as the **written revelation of God**.

## Talmud and Midrash

- **Midrash** – biblical exegesis and commentary.  
- **Talmud** – discussions and legal opinions of thousands of rabbis on many subjects.  
- Forms the basis for later **Jewish law codes**.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Clarify that for rabbinic Judaism, Torah is central, but Talmud and later law are how Torah is actually lived.

---

# Teachings of Judaism – One God

## Shema Yisrael

- Deut 6:4 – “Hear, O Israel: YHWH is our God, YHWH is one.”  
- Central declaration of Jewish faith.  
- Recited daily and in liturgy.

### The Divine Name (Tetragrammaton)

- **YHWH** – “tetragrammaton” (four-letter name).  
- Related to Hebrew verb **hayah** (“to be”).  
- Indicates God’s **self-existence** and uncreated nature.  
- Observant Jews do not pronounce this name aloud.  
- Instead substitute titles like **Adonai** (“my Lord”) or simply **HaShem** (“the Name”).

## “I AM” – Exodus 3:13–14

- God’s self-identification to Moses: “I AM THAT I AM.”  
- Expresses:  
  - Eternal self-existence.  
  - Ineffability (beyond full human comprehension).  
  - Active presence with the people.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Good moment to tie Jewish and Christian readings of the divine name together, while keeping focus on Jewish understanding in this course.

---

# Titles of Deity in Judaism

- **El** – generic word for God.  
- **El Shaddai** – “God of the Mountain” or “God Almighty.”  
- **El Elyon** – “Most High God.”  
- **Adonai** – “My Lord.”  
- **HaShem** – “The Name.”  
- **HaKadosh Baruch Hu** – “The Holy One, blessed be He.”

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Have students consider what each title emphasizes about God’s character.

---

# Teachings of Judaism – Messiah

- **Messiah** (mashiach) = “anointed one.”  
- Anticipated **savior and redeemer** of the Jewish people.  
- Future king from the **Davidic line**.  
- Key prophetic passages: **Isaiah 9:6–7; 11:1–9**.  
  - “Government upon his shoulder.”  
  - “Upon the throne of David.”  
- Many Jews look for a **political and national** savior who will restore Jewish sovereignty and justice.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Connect to later differences with Christian claims about Jesus as messiah.

---

# The Law of Moses

- Found in the **Torah** – stories and commandments for life and death.  
- Rabbis enumerate **613 commandments** (mitzvot).  
- All commandments come from God.  
- Includes:  
  - **Ten Commandments**.  
  - **Sacrifices and offerings**.  
  - **Holiness Code** (especially Leviticus 17–26).

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Emphasize that for Judaism, law is not “legalism” but a path of holiness and covenant faithfulness.

---

# The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20)

- Given by God to Israel after deliverance from Egypt.  
- Divided between:  
  - Duties to God.  
  - Duties to fellow humans.

## Preamble

> “I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.”

Key points:

- Ethical monotheism rooted in **liberation**: God frees slaves, then gives law.  
- God is source of morality, above human opinion.  
- Most commandments concern how we treat others.  
- Freedom depends on **moral self-control**.  
- God cares deeply about human beings (His creation).

## Commandment 1 – No Other Gods

- “You shall have no other gods before Me.”  
- One God → one human race → one moral standard.  
- When false gods are worshipped, injustice and oppression follow.

## Commandment 3 – Name of God

- Hebrew literally: “Do not **carry** the name of the LORD your God in vain” (or “do not misuse the name”).  
- God will not hold guiltless those who misuse God’s name.  
- Includes:  
  - Swearing falsely by God.  
  - Using God’s name to justify evil.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Ask students for examples of doing evil “in God’s name” historically and today.

## Commandment 4 – Sabbath

- “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.”  
- Based on God’s rest on seventh day.  
- From Friday sunset to Saturday sunset.  
- Prohibits work for all in the household, including slaves and animals.  
- Includes special meals and synagogue attendance.  
- Re-creates **sacred time** and elevates human life by mandating rest.

## Remaining Commandments (5–10)

- Honor your father and mother.  
- You shall not murder.  
- You shall not commit adultery.  
- You shall not steal.  
- You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.  
- You shall not covet.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Highlight how these form the backbone of later Jewish and Christian ethics, and many modern legal norms.

---

# Sacrifices and Offerings

- See Leviticus 1 and following.  
- **Moses and Aaron** are from tribe of **Levi**.  
- Tribe of **Levi** receives no land inheritance; instead, Levites become **priestly tribe**.  
- Priests (sons of Aaron) responsible for:  
  - Performing sacrifices.  
  - Maintaining ritual purity.  
  - Teaching the law.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Transition here to discuss how sacrifice functions as symbolic communication with God—then how it is later replaced by prayer and good deeds after Temple destruction.

---

# Holiness Code (Law of Holiness)

- Centered in **Leviticus 19** and surrounding chapters.  
- Holiness = sacred, set apart, separate from the profane.  
- Imitation of the divine is the basis of human behavior:  
  - “You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy.”  
- Contains a collection of:  
  - Secular regulations.  
  - Ritual regulations.  
  - Moral and ethical injunctions.  
  - Festival and calendar laws.  
  - Dietary restrictions (**kosher**).  
  - Sexual restrictions.

**Key Themes**

- Avoid profane and polluting practices of neighboring peoples.  
- Holiness is lived in concrete actions, not just inner feelings.  
- Ritual, ethics, and spirituality are **intertwined**, not separate spheres.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> A good closing activity: have students find one rule from the Holiness Code and explain what value it is trying to protect (life, justice, purity, compassion, etc.).

---

# Closing Reflection

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Close by drawing lines between:  
> - The covenant story (Abraham, Exodus, Sinai) and Jewish identity today.  
> - Ethical monotheism and modern ideas of universal human dignity.  
> - Temple–sacrifice–land and synagogue–Torah–Diaspora.  
> Encourage students to see Judaism not just as “background” to Christianity and Islam, but as a living tradition in its own right.
