# Encountering Hinduism: Many Paths to Liberation
## Chapter Three

---

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> This chapter is a perfect place to hammer home that “Hinduism” is not one tidy system but a huge, layered civilizational tradition. Keep reminding students: many paths, many deities, many philosophies—but recurring themes of dharma, karma, samsara, and moksha.

# Lecture Schedule

# Hinduism – Basic Orientation

- Hinduism emerges out of the ancient **Indus River Valley civilization**.  
- Today, it is practiced by **more than a billion** people in and beyond India.  
- It represents a **wide variety of beliefs** with little obvious unity.  
- No single human founder.  
- No fixed, universal creed.  
- No centralized authority comparable to a pope.  
- Reverence for the **Vedas** and commitment to **dharma** are common threads.  
- Historically, **not a universal missionary religion** in the way Christianity or Islam are.  
- The term *Hindu* originally:  
  - An ancient Persian word (ca. 500 BCE) for inhabitants of the Indus River region.  
  - “Hinduism” is an umbrella term gradually imposed from outside, later embraced by many insiders.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Stress how “Hinduism” as a category is relatively late. Ask: what happens when outsiders name your tradition? How might that shape identity?

# The Hindu Present as Shaped by Its Past

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> This header is your cue to shift from definitions to deep history: Indus Valley → Vedic → Upanishadic → Classical → Devotional. Draw a timeline on the board.

# Indus Valley / Dravidian Civilization (ca. 3000–1500 BCE)

- Agricultural villages grow into cities like **Harappa** and **Mohenjo-Daro**.  
- Inhabitants: darker-skinned peoples often called **Dravidians**.  
- Civilization flourishes between **3000 BCE and 1500 BCE**.  
- Collapse likely due to **environmental problems**, not a single dramatic invasion.

## Dravidian Religion (What We Can Infer)

Because the script is undeciphered, scholars rely on archaeology:

- **Public buildings** that may have been used for ritual purposes.  
- **Statues and figurines** suggesting worship of fertility goddesses.  
- Numerous **female deity figurines**.  
- Evidence of a **fertility cult** and nature worship:  
  - Rites to ensure productivity of plants, animals, and people.  
  - Possible early roots of later **Shakti** (divine feminine power) worship.  
- Strong emphasis on **birth, death, and rebirth**.

### Fertility Cult (Definition)

- A system of nature worship using rites and ceremonies believed to ensure productiveness of plants, animals, and people.  
- Often directed toward propitiating a special fertility deity.

## Representative Artefacts (Indus Valley)

- “Priest-King” figure.  
- “Dancing Girl” bronze.  
- Standing mother / mother-goddess figurines.  
- Bull imagery.  
- Horned fertility god depictions.  
- “Venus figurines” (parallels with Mesopotamian figurines).

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Use images if you can. Ask students: what can we responsibly infer (and *not* infer) from material culture without texts?

---

# Indo-European Migrations (ca. 5000–900 BCE)

- Movements of **Indo-European–speaking peoples** across Eurasia over many centuries.  
- One branch moves into the Indian subcontinent.  
- This sets up contact and eventual blending with Dravidian populations.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Clarify that “Aryan” here is a linguistic-cultural term from older scholarship, not the racist misuse of the word in Nazi ideology.

---

# The Vedic Period (ca. 1500–600 BCE)

## The Vedas

- Earliest religious texts of ancient India: **Vedas** (“wisdom” or “knowledge”).  
- Preserve the religious knowledge priests needed to perform sacrifice.  
- Collections of **hymns, prayers, and rituals** honoring various gods.  
- **Rig Veda**: earliest and most important, compiled ca. 1400–900 BCE.  
- Contains:  
  - Creation stories.  
  - Hymns to deities.  
  - Ritual instructions.

### Aryans and Dravidians

- Vedas imply clashes between **Aryans** and **Dravidians**.  
- Dravidians often referred to as **dasa** (“slave,” “servant,” “barbarian”).

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Connect the Vedic religion to the later caste system and the social hierarchy it supports.

---

# The Vedic Caste System (Varna)

Question: **How to maintain social order?**

- Aryans develop a **strong hereditary social order** and patriarchy.  
- As Aryans and Dravidians intermingle, concept of **varna** (“color”) develops.  
- Initially may imply racial distinctions; later becomes a **rigid class system**.  
- Classic four-fold varna structure (Rig Veda 10.90, Purusha Sukta):  
  - **Brahmin** – priests (mouth).  
  - **Rajanya / Kshatriya** – rulers and warriors (arms).  
  - **Vaishya** – merchants and commoners (thighs).  
  - **Shudra** – servants and laborers (feet).

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> If you quote the Purusha hymn, highlight how cosmic imagery legitimizes social hierarchy. Also note scholarly debates about whether this hymn describes reality or an ideal.

---

# Varna and Dalits

## Dalits (Formerly “Untouchables”)

- Called **Harijan** (“children of God”) by Gandhi—also an Indian euphemism for “illegitimate children.”  
- Many today prefer the term **Dalit** (“oppressed ones”).  
- Historically **outside** the fourfold varna system.  
- Performed tasks considered ritually polluting in traditional Hindu society:  
  - Butchery, tanning, removal of animal carcasses.  
  - Cleaning latrines and sewers.  
- Untouchability became a **hereditary status**, leading to deep social discrimination.

## Jati – Birth Group

- **Jati** means “birth.”  
- In practice, one’s **jati** is more important than the abstract varna.  
- Thousands of jatis function as:  
  - Local castes.  
  - Often tied to clan, tribe, or occupation.  
- A person is expected to:  
  - Marry within their jati.  
  - Follow the occupational and social patterns of their birth group.

> **Class Discussion Prompt:**  
> What do you think the appeal of the caste system was for it to last thousands of years? Why are reformers trying to dismantle it today?

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Tie this to questions of social stability vs. justice. Also mention contemporary legal bans on caste discrimination in India and ongoing realities of inequality.

# Vedic Religion (Vedism): Sacrifice and the Gods

- Gods play a crucial role in human life; divine forces can be **influenced by sacrifice**.  
- Vedic sacrifices:  
  - Strengthen the deities.  
  - In turn, deities strengthen and sustain the cosmos.  
- Sacrifice **re-creates sacred time** and helps maintain cosmic order.  
- Rituals include:  
  - Chanted hymns.  
  - Drinking of **soma** (a sacred, possibly psychoactive drink).  
  - Animal sacrifice.

## Major Vedic Deities

### Indra

- King of the gods in the Rig Veda.  
- Wields the **thunderbolt** and brings rain.  
- Warrior god who helps Aryans defeat enemies, human and demonic.  
- Strengthened by offerings of soma.

### Agni

- God of **fire**; second only to Indra in many hymns.  
- Fire of the sun, lightning, and hearth.  
- **Carries sacrifices** from humans to the gods.  
- Central to many rituals, including **Agnihotra**.

### Agnihotra Ritual

- Example of a Vedic ritual still practiced today.  
- Performed daily by the **head of household**.  
- Fire god **Agni** carries offerings to:  
  - Indra (king of the gods).  
  - Varuna (god of moral order).  
  - Brahma (creator god).  
- **Rishi** (“seer”) = person who directly experiences the divine:  
  - Attains altered states of consciousness (sometimes linked to soma).  
  - Credited with composing the Vedic hymns.  
- Over time, religious and social power become concentrated in **Brahmin** priests;  
  - Vedism becomes a **sacrificial cult dominated by Brahmins**.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Ask students to compare Vedic sacrifice with sacrifice in other ancient religions (Greek, Israelite, etc.). Where are the similarities and differences?

---

# Upanishadic Period (ca. 600–400 BCE)

- Brahmin monopoly over ritual alienates those of other castes.  
- Growing dissatisfaction with external ritual leads to deeper philosophical questions:  
  - What is the meaning of life?  
  - What is ultimate reality?  
- Contact with Dravidian traditions brings in ideas of **rebirth (samsara)**.  
- Aryan and Dravidian beliefs merge in new speculative texts: the **Upanishads**.

## The Upanishads

- Philosophical scriptures at the **end of the Vedic period**.  
- Often structured as **dialogues** between teacher and student.  
- Seek sacred knowledge through withdrawal from ordinary life.  
- Esoteric teaching → veneration of the **guru**.  
- Around **150** texts in total: some very brief, some quite long.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> This is where you transition from ritual to metaphysics: karma, samsara, atman, Brahman.

---

# Classical Period (ca. 400 BCE–600 CE)

- Vedic-based religion challenged by **Buddhism** and **Jainism**.  
- In response, Hinduism begins to **define itself** more clearly and to integrate new elements.  
- Hinduism reaffirms some things that Buddhism and Jainism reject (e.g., Vedas, caste).  
- **Upanishads** are accepted as part of the Vedic scriptural body.  
- Local, non-Aryan deities are incorporated into the wider Hindu pantheon.  
- Non-Aryans folded into the system as lower castes and outcastes.  
- By the **7th century CE**, Hinduism returns to religious dominance on the subcontinent.

## Important Literature from the Classical Period

- (Use this section in class to introduce the epics if you wish: *Mahabharata*, *Ramayana*, etc., and the *Bhagavad Gita* as part of that corpus.)

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Even if you don’t go text-by-text, emphasize how epics teach dharma through story.

---

# The Devotional Period (600 CE–Present)

## Historical Context

- Long-standing **trade** between India and Arabia.  
- After rise of **Islam** (7th century), Arab traders bring Islam into India.  
- Repeated Muslim invasions; by early **13th century**, Muslims establish the **Delhi Sultanate**.  
- Synthesis of **Islamic** and **Indian** civilizations.  
- India becomes part of a larger **world-system**.  
- Early **16th century**: Central Asian Muslim rulers form the **Mughal dynasty**.  
- By **1700**, the Mughals control almost the entire subcontinent.

## Dual Influence of Islam

- Encourages **conversion** to Islam among some.  
- Encourages **monotheistic and egalitarian trends** among Hindus.  
- Contributes to the rise of:  
  - **Sikhism** (see ch. 6).  
  - New **devotional (bhakti)** movements.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Point out that external pressure can provoke both assimilation and creative renewal inside a tradition.

---

# Beliefs and Practices in Hinduism

- No single historical founder.  
- No central church-like structure.  
- Many forms and **paths (yogas)** of religious practice.  
- Traditionally **tolerant** of multiple deities and practices.  
- Possible to worship different gods or follow different yogas and still be Hindu.

### Bhakti (Devotion)

- Advocates in southern India (ca. 6th century CE) use poetry and song to praise **Shiva** and **Vishnu**.  
- By the **17th century**, bhakti has spread into most Hindu traditions.  
- Focus on **personal devotion** to a chosen deity.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Give students examples of bhakti poetry; they’re emotionally powerful and accessible.

---

# The Quest for Brahman

- **Rishis** (sages) ponder Vedic hymns, especially the **Hymn of Origins**.  
- Ask: Who is **“THAT ONE”** by which all things exist?

## Brahman

- That which is greatest; than which nothing is greater.  
- The **supreme existence** or **absolute reality**.  
- Eternal, conscious, irreducible, infinite, omnipresent.  
- Spiritual core of the universe of finiteness and change.  
- Often described as:  
  - **Sat** – being.  
  - **Chit** – consciousness.  
  - **Ananda** – bliss.

> “THAT ONE breathed, without breath, by its own impulse; other than THAT, there was nothing at all.”

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Help students see this as a shift from many gods to a concern with ultimate reality behind them.

---

# The Quest for the Ultimate Self (Atman)

## Atman

- The **innermost self**; eternal or universal self.  
- Life-force within all beings; that which animates the organs and faculties.  
- Ultimate **agent of human action**.  
- Directs perception, thought, and knowledge.  
- Lies at the deepest layer of the self, beneath more surface identities.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Contrast this with Western notions of individual ego or personality. Atman is deeper and more universal.

---

# Samsara and Moksha

- **Atman** is trapped in an endless series of births and deaths (**samsara**) due to desire and attachment.  
- Good or bad actions (**karma**) shape future rebirths.  
- Samsara is understood as a state of **suffering** and **bondage**, not a good thing.  
- The religious problem: **How can one be freed from this endless cycle?**  
- **Moksha** = liberation or release from karma and samsara.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Ask students to compare “salvation” in Hindu thought (moksha) with Christian salvation and Buddhist nirvana—similar problem, different metaphysics.

---

# Paths to Moksha – Yoga

**Yoga** (“to yoke, join”) = path or discipline for union with the divine.

- Different Hindus emphasize different yogas:  
  - **Jnana Yoga** – path of knowledge.  
  - **Karma Yoga** – path of action / work.  
  - **Bhakti Yoga** – path of devotion.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Remind students that “yoga” here is primarily a spiritual discipline, not just exercise class poses.

---

# Jnana Yoga – Path of Knowledge

- Most **intellectual** path to liberation.  
- Associated especially with **Advaita Vedanta** (non-dualistic philosophy).  
- Rejects dualism between God and world; asserts **non-dualism (monism)**.  
- Classic formula from the *Chandogya Upanishad*: **“Tat tvam asi”** – “Thou art that.”

## Brahman and Atman

- Only **Brahman** truly exists.  
- Brahman is present in all beings as **atman**.  
- Atman = individual’s innermost self or soul; a temporary delineation of Brahman.  
- Analogies:  
  - A **wave** to the ocean.  
  - Air inside a **jar** relative to the surrounding sky.  
- Hindu religious quest: realize that **Brahman and Atman are one**.  
- Change, duality, and plurality are **maya** (illusion, or “appearance”).  
- Realization of this truth brings:  
  - Freedom from ignorance and misery.  
  - **Moksha** from samsara.

### Jnana Yoga Practices

- Renunciation.  
- Asceticism.  
- Celibacy.  
- Meditation and contemplative discipline.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Students may find this abstract; connect to more familiar analogies (ocean/waves, sun/rays).

---

# Bhakti Yoga – Path of Devotion

- Path of **worship and loving devotion** to a personal deity.  
- Currently the **most popular** path among many Hindus.  
- Worship can be at home or in temples.  
- Represents blending of:  
  - Dravidian fertility and nature gods.  
  - Aryan sky and war gods.  

## The Trimurti (“Three Forms”)

- **Brahma** – creator.  
- **Vishnu** – preserver.  
- **Shiva** – destroyer / transformer.

### Brahma

- Creative force.  
- One myth: Brahma emerges from Vishnu’s navel.  
- Plays relatively **small role** in modern Hindu devotion.

### Vishnu – God of Life

- Supervises **universal order and prosperity**.  
- Protects and **preserves** the world.  
- **Avatars** (incarnations) come when world is out of balance:  
  - **Rama** in the *Ramayana*.  
  - **Krishna** in the *Bhagavad Gita*.  
- Consort: **Lakshmi**, goddess of fortune and prosperity.

### Shakti – The Goddess

- Powerful upholder of the universe (in Rig Veda imagery).  
- Worshipped as **Devi** or **Mahadevi**.  
- Feminine divine power seen as source of:  
  - Creation.  
  - Preservation.  
  - Destruction.  
- Manifest in many forms:  
  - **Lakshmi**.  
  - **Kali**.  
  - **Durga**.

### Shiva – God of Destruction and Transformation

- Guides and empowers **destruction in the cosmic cycle** of creation, dissolution, and re-creation.  
- Destruction = removal of obstacles to salvation.  
- Death as **prelude to rebirth** → Shiva also associated with **fertility**.  
- Fertility aspects of older Dravidian gods appear strongly in Shiva.  
- Shiva often represented by the **lingam**, a symbol of divine energy with roots in wider phallic symbolism and ritual.  
- Also depicted as **Shiva Nataraja** (“Lord of the Dance”):  
  - Dancing within a ring of fire.  
  - Symbolizing cosmic cycles and the rhythm of creation and destruction.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Handle sexual symbolism carefully and academically. Emphasize that for many Hindus, these forms are deeply sacred, not crude.

# Hindu Doctrinal Concepts

## Dharma

- Righteousness, law, duty, moral teaching, religion, and cosmic order.  
- Specific to:  
  - Social position.  
  - Caste membership.  
  - Stage of life.  
  - Gender.  
- Faithful performance of one’s **class and caste dharma** leads to better reincarnation.

## Key Terms

- **Samsara** – cycle of reincarnation.  
- **Jiva** – the individual soul that gathers karma and is reborn.  
- **Karma** – actions or deeds and their consequences.  
- **Moksha** – liberation from rebirth and samsara.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Have students create a concept map linking dharma, karma, samsara, and moksha.

# The Bhagavad Gita – A Brief Introduction

- Part of the **Mahabharata** epic.  
- Presents a dialogue between Prince **Arjuna** and **Krishna** (his charioteer, revealed as divine).  
- Set on the eve of a great battle.

## Arjuna’s Dilemma

- Question: **To fight or not to fight?**  
- As a warrior (kshatriya), his **dharma** is to fight.  
- But fighting his own kin threatens to:  
  - Destroy families.  
  - Undermine social and moral order (**ahimsa**, non-harm).  
- If he fights, he violates one set of moral demands; if he refuses, he violates another.  
- Arjuna prefers to **lay down his weapons and die** rather than fight (Gita 1:47).

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Use this as case study in conflict of duties—very relatable for students.

---

# Krishna Instructs Arjuna

- Krishna tells Arjuna he **must fight**:  
  - Be honorable (Gita 2:3).  
  - Fulfill his warrior **dharma** (Gita 2:31, 33).  
  - Killing in battle is ultimately **illusory** at the level of the eternal self (Gita 2:19).  
- The entire battlefield becomes a **metaphor** for the struggle between good and evil.  
- Message: good people must sometimes **enter the fight**; evil triumphs when good people refuse to act.

## Krishna on the Self and the Gunas

- Krishna teaches that the **ultimate self (atman)** is identical with ultimate reality and **unchanging**.  
- The **lower self** is made up of the **gunas**, strands of “energy-matter”:  
  - **Sattva** – goodness, constructive, harmonious.  
  - **Rajas** – passion, activity, restlessness.  
  - **Tamas** – darkness, inertia, destructiveness.  
- All three gunas are present in everyone; moral character reflects their **relative balance**.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> You can compare gunas loosely to personality “ingredients” or tendencies—but stress that in the Gita they are metaphysical, not mere personality traits.

---

# Nonattached Action – Karma Yoga and Bhakti

- Attachment to the **guna-self** creates bondage.  
- Because people have different guna-makeup, Krishna teaches multiple paths (**yogas**):  
  - Knowledge (jnana).  
  - Work (karma).  
  - Devotion (bhakti).  
- Key principle: **act without attachment** to the fruits of action.  
- Cooperate with the guna-self in order to **transcend** it.

### How to Free Oneself from the Gunas?

- Continue to perform your **dharma**, but:  
  - Release fixation on success or failure.  
  - Offer the results of action to God.  
- Krishna presents **bhakti** (devotion) as the **easiest** way to practice nonattachment:  
  - Dedicate action and its fruits to **Krishna**.  
  - Krishna functions as finite form of the infinite (Atman/Brahman).  
  - Worship of Krishna becomes a path to **moksha**.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> This is a nice place to bring the whole chapter together: ultimate reality (Brahman), true self (atman), moral duty (dharma), and liberation (moksha) all converge in this text.

---

# Analysis of the Bhagavad Gita

- Ingenious attempt to **reconcile duty and liberation**.  
- Gita insists on absolute importance of **dharma** in sustaining cosmic and social order.  
- It is not **action** itself that binds, but **attachment** to the fruits of action.  
- Therefore:  
  - Moksha does **not** require renouncing action or abandoning dharma.  
  - It requires **renouncing attachment** while continuing to act (cf. Gita 18:5–6).  
- Bhakti provides a practical path:  
  - Direct devotion to God (Krishna) allows one to act vigorously while remaining inwardly free.

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> Ask students whether they find this solution convincing. Can you act fully in the world without clinging to outcomes?

---

# Closing Reflection

> **Instructor Notes:**  
> To close, draw three lines:  
> 1. From Indus Valley fertility cults to Vedic sacrifice to Upanishadic philosophy to bhakti devotion – a story of continuity and change.  
> 2. From caste and dharma to modern debates over social justice and reform in India.  
> 3. From Gita’s nonattached action to modern questions about vocation, activism, and inner freedom.
