## **CASE STUDY A: Hindu Pilgrimage to the Ganges River**

### **The Scenario:**

Rajesh, a 45-year-old Hindu man from Mumbai, travels with his elderly mother to Varanasi (also called Benares or Kashi) on the banks of the Ganges River. They arrive during the festival of Kumbh Mela, when millions of pilgrims gather.

Rajesh and his mother perform several rituals:
- They bathe in the Ganges at sunrise, believing the water purifies them of sins
- They offer flowers and small oil lamps (diyas) that float downstream
- They visit multiple temples along the riverbank
- They purchase small clay idols of Ganesha from vendors
- Rajesh's mother scatters her late husband's ashes in the river, as tradition prescribes
- They hire a Brahmin priest to perform puja (worship ritual) on the ghats (steps)
- In the evening, they participate in Ganga Aarti — a collective ceremony with fire, music, and chanting

While there, Rajesh uses his smartphone to livestream the aarti ceremony to family members back in Mumbai who couldn't make the journey. His teenage niece watches from her apartment while studying for exams.

### **Questions for Your Group:**

**1. Worldview:**
What worldview assumptions underlie these practices? How do they answer questions about the sacred, the nature of reality, ethics, or life after death?

**2. Building Blocks:**
Identify specific examples of:
- **Myth:** What sacred narratives might give meaning to these practices?
- **Ritual:** Describe the symbolic actions. What do they accomplish?
- **Material religion:** What objects, senses, physical elements are involved?
- **Community:** How does this practice create or reinforce social bonds?

**3. Sacred/Ultimate:**
What is sacred in this scenario? How is the sacred encountered or experienced?

**4. Ideal vs. Lived:**
Can you identify any gaps between "textbook Hinduism" and how Rajesh and his mother actually practice? (Hint: Think about the smartphone livestreaming, purchasing idols from vendors, blending of different traditions)

**5. Approaches:**
- What would a **functionalist** ask about this pilgrimage? (What does it DO for individuals or society?)
- What would a **substantive theorist** ask? (What does it MEAN to the pilgrims?)

**6. Methods:**
- How might a **phenomenologist** approach studying this? What would they want to understand?
- What would a **historian** want to know about the development of these practices?

**7. Critical Awareness:**
- What assumptions might a Western observer bring to this scene?
- How might Rajesh himself describe what's happening differently than an outside scholar would?
- Does the "world religions" framework help or hinder understanding practices that blend multiple Hindu traditions?

## **CASE STUDY B: Muslim Student Navigating Ramadan on Campus**

### **The Scenario:**

Aisha is a 19-year-old Muslim student at a large public university. It's the month of Ramadan, and she's observing the traditional fast from sunrise to sunset. Her challenges include:

**Daily Practice:**
- She wakes at 4:30 AM for suhoor (pre-dawn meal) in her dorm room, trying not to wake her non-Muslim roommate
- She skips lunch with friends, explaining she's fasting, which leads to questions ("Not even water?" "Why would God want you to be hungry?")
- She attends classes while fasting, sometimes feeling tired or having trouble concentrating
- She uses a prayer app on her phone that alerts her to the five daily prayer times
- She finds a quiet corner in the library to pray, rolling out a small prayer rug she carries in her backpack
- She breaks her fast (iftar) at sunset, sometimes alone in her room, sometimes at the Muslim Student Association's communal iftar dinners
- At night, she attends tarawih prayers at the local mosque (special Ramadan night prayers)

**Complications:**
- Her chemistry lab is scheduled during one prayer time; she prays before/after instead of during the prescribed time
- She has a major exam during Ramadan; some friends suggest she should break the fast to have energy, but she chooses to fast anyway
- Her non-Muslim friends invite her to a party; she attends but doesn't eat or drink, which makes some people uncomfortable
- She follows several Muslim influencers on Instagram and TikTok who post about their Ramadan experiences
- On weekends, she volunteers at a community food bank (part of Ramadan's emphasis on charity and helping the poor)

### **Questions for Your Group:**

**1. Worldview:**
What worldview questions does Ramadan observance address? (Think: purpose, ethics, relationship to the divine, community)

**2. Building Blocks:**
Identify examples of:
- **Myth:** What sacred narratives give meaning to Ramadan? (You may need to infer)
- **Ritual:** Describe the patterned actions. What makes them rituals rather than just habits?
- **Belief:** What theological ideas motivate Aisha's fasting and prayer?
- **Community:** How does Ramadan create community? What happens when community is absent (eating alone)?

**3. Material Religion:**
What physical objects or bodily experiences are central to Aisha's practice? (prayer rug, phone app, food/hunger, etc.)

**4. Practice vs. Belief:**
Does Aisha emphasize *doing* (practice) or *believing* (doctrine) more? Or both equally?

**5. Ideal vs. Lived:**
Where do you see gaps between the "ideal" (textbook Islam, prescribed rituals) and Aisha's actual lived experience?
- Think about: timing adjustments for class, praying alone vs. in mosque, using technology

**6. Approaches:**
- **Functionalist question:** What psychological or social functions does Ramadan fasting serve for Aisha?
- **Substantive question:** What does Ramadan *mean* to Aisha? What is her conscious intention and motivation?

**7. Methods:**
- How would a **phenomenologist** try to understand Aisha's experience? What would they want to hear from her directly?
- How would an **anthropologist** studying "lived religion" approach this?

**8. Contemporary Context (Digital Religion):**
- How does technology shape Aisha's religious practice? (prayer app, Instagram, TikTok)
- Is this still "authentic" religion if it involves smartphones and social media?

**9. Critical Awareness:**
- What stereotypes about Islam might non-Muslim observers bring to this scenario?
- How might Aisha describe her own experience differently than an outsider would?

## **CASE STUDY C: Indigenous Tradition Blending Christianity and Ancestral Practices**

### **The Scenario:**

Maria lives in a small village in the highlands of Guatemala. Her community identifies as Catholic — the result of Spanish colonization in the 16th century — but their actual religious practice blends Catholic and Maya traditions in ways that might surprise a European Catholic.

**Sunday Mass:**
- The village gathers in a Catholic church with santos (saint statues)
- The priest (who visits from a larger town) conducts Mass in Spanish and K'iche' (the local Maya language)
- But before Mass, the community performs ceremonies at outdoor altars with copal incense, corn, and offerings to mountain spirits
- Inside the church, saint statues are dressed in traditional Maya clothing
- People pray to saints but also address Nawales (animal spirit guides from Maya cosmology)
- Confession includes both Catholic sins and transgressions against community harmony

**Home Practice:**
- Maria maintains a home altar with: a crucifix, candles, photos of deceased family members, ears of corn (sacred in Maya tradition), and incense
- She prays to God and Jesus but also to her ancestors and to the spirit of the land
- When her daughter is sick, she first consults a traditional aj q'ij (Maya spiritual guide) who performs a divination ceremony, then also takes her to the Catholic church to light candles to the Virgin Mary
- She participates in the Catholic Easter celebration but also observes the Maya New Year based on the traditional calendar

**Community Tensions:**
- Some younger people (who've moved to the city) say this isn't "real" Christianity
- Some Catholic officials from the capital have criticized these practices as "pagan" or "syncretistic"
- But for Maria, this is simply how her people have practiced for generations — it's not "mixing" two separate religions; it's one coherent tradition

### **Questions for Your Group:**

**1. Labels and Categories:**
- Is Maria's tradition "Catholic"? "Maya"? Both? Neither? Something else entirely?
- What does this case reveal about the limits of the "world religions" framework?
- How do labels like "Catholicism" obscure the actual diversity of practice?

**2. Worldview:**
What worldview does this tradition express? How does it answer questions about:
- The sacred (what/who is sacred?)
- The universe (spirits, ancestors, saints — how do they relate?)
- Ethics and morality (what's emphasized?)

**3. Building Blocks:**
Identify examples of:
- **Myth:** What sacred narratives give meaning to these practices? (Consider both Catholic and Maya stories)
- **Ritual:** Describe the blended rituals. What elements come from each tradition?
- **Material religion:** What objects are sacred? How do they function?
- **Community:** Who defines acceptable practice? What happens when authorities disagree?

**4. Ideal vs. Lived:**
This is a perfect example of "lived religion." Compare:
- **Ideal (textbook Catholicism):** What would the Vatican say these practices should look like?
- **Lived (Maria's actual practice):** What does she actually do?
- Why might "ideal vs. lived" be too simple a framework here? (Is there one "ideal" or multiple competing ideals?)

**5. Insider vs. Outsider:**
- How might Maria describe her own practice? (She might not see it as "blending" two religions)
- How might an outside scholar categorize it? (Syncretism? Hybrid? Indigenous Christianity?)
- How might Vatican officials categorize it? (Authentic Catholicism? Corrupted by paganism?)
- Who gets to decide?

**6. Approaches:**
- **Functionalist:** What social or psychological functions do these blended practices serve for the community?
- **Substantive:** What do these practices *mean* to Maria and her community? What beliefs motivate them?

**7. Methods:**
- How would a **phenomenologist** approach this? (Remember: empathetic understanding in practitioners' own terms)
- What challenges would a **historian** face trying to trace the development of these practices?

**8. Critical Awareness:**
- What assumptions might cause outsiders to misunderstand this practice?
  * The assumption that religions are separate, bounded systems?
  * The assumption that "pure" traditions are more authentic?
  * Western colonial hierarchies (Christianity as "superior" to indigenous practices)?
- What does this case reveal about how colonialism shaped religion?

**9. Multiple Belonging:**
Does the concept of "multiple belonging" (from Day 2) fit here? Or is this better understood as a single, coherent tradition?

## **CASE STUDY D: Buddhist Meditation App with 10 Million Users**

### **The Scenario:**

**Mindful Path** is a meditation app with 10 million downloads. It was created by a team of developers, some of whom practice Buddhism and some who don't. The app offers:

**Features:**
- Guided meditation sessions (5-60 minutes) led by voices with soothing accents
- Teachings from Buddhist texts (Dhammapada, Heart Sutra, etc.) explained in simple English
- Virtual sangha (community) — users can post about their practice and encourage each other
- Progress tracking — users earn badges for consecutive days of practice
- Premium version ($9.99/month) unlocks longer sessions and special courses
- Integration with Apple Watch to track heart rate during meditation
- Background music options (Tibetan singing bowls, nature sounds)
- Option to dedicate your practice to someone in need

**Users:**
The app's users are diverse:
- **User A:** A 30-year-old programmer in Silicon Valley who doesn't identify as Buddhist but meditates for stress management and productivity. He listens while commuting.
- **User B:** A 50-year-old woman who attends a local Zen center but uses the app for home practice between in-person sessions. She's been Buddhist for 20 years.
- **User C:** A 19-year-old college student who's curious about Buddhism. The app is her only exposure to Buddhist teaching. She's never met a Buddhist in person.
- **User D:** A therapist who recommends the app to clients for anxiety management. She doesn't practice herself but sees it as a therapeutic tool.

**Debates:**
- Some traditional Buddhist teachers say the app commodifies dharma (teaching) and reduces Buddhism to stress management, losing its deeper spiritual goals
- Some users say the app makes Buddhism accessible to people who'd never enter a temple
- Critics note the app is run by a for-profit company — can you sell dharma?
- Supporters say Buddhist teachings have always adapted to new cultures and technologies

### **Questions for Your Group:**

**1. Is This Religion?**
Using definitions from Chapter 1, is using this app a "religious" practice?
- Apply **Durkheim's definition:** Does it create community? Reinforce values?
- Apply **Otto's definition:** Is there experience of the numinous or sacred?
- Apply **Bellah's definition:** Does it relate people to "ultimate conditions of existence"?
- What does your answer reveal about how we define religion?

**2. Digital Religion:**
- How does technology *change* religious practice, not just transmit it?
- Does meditating via app feel different than meditating in a temple? Does that matter?
- Is the virtual sangha (online community) a "real" religious community?

**3. Ideal vs. Lived:**
- **Ideal (traditional Buddhism):** Meditation as part of a comprehensive path (ethics, wisdom, meditation); taught by authorized teachers; practiced in community; non-commercial
- **Lived (app users):** Meditation as one practice among many; self-guided or app-guided; often solitary; commodified
- Are these different religions? Evolutionary stages? Equally valid expressions?

**4. Practice vs. Belief:**
Notice that the app emphasizes *practice* (meditation technique) over *belief* (Buddhist doctrines). What does this reveal about Western appropriation of Buddhism?

**5. Approaches:**
- **Functionalist:** What does the app *do* for users?
  * For User A (stress management)?
  * For User B (supplement to in-person practice)?
  * For User C (introduction to Buddhism)?
- **Substantive:** What does meditation *mean* to each type of user? Are their meanings compatible with Buddhist teachings?

**6. Methods:**
- How would a **phenomenologist** study this? (Hint: They'd need to interview users, not just analyze the app itself)
- What would a **historian of religions** want to trace? (Development of Buddhism → digital Buddhism?)

**7. Commodification:**
- Is it problematic to charge $9.99/month for access to Buddhist teachings?
- What would a **Marxist** (functionalist) critique say about religion in capitalist markets?
- What might traditional Buddhist teachers say about selling dharma?

**8. Authority:**
- Who has authority to teach Buddhism?
  * Traditional: Lineage-authorized teachers, monastics
  * Digital: App developers, anyone who can code?
- Does democratizing access undermine tradition, or fulfill Buddhism's goal of making dharma available to all?

**9. Multiple Definitions of "Buddhist":**
- Is User A a Buddhist? (Uses Buddhist techniques but doesn't identify as Buddhist)
- Is User C a Buddhist? (Considers herself Buddhist but has no traditional training or community)
- Who gets to decide who counts as Buddhist?
- What does this reveal about how we categorize religious identity?

**10. Critical Awareness:**
- What Western assumptions shape this app? (Individualism? Consumer choice? Optimization/productivity?)
- How might a traditional Tibetan monk view this app?
- Is this cultural appropriation, adaptation, or both?

## **GROUP DISCUSSION FRAMEWORK**

**For All Case Studies:**

After discussing the specific questions, step back and consider:

**1. What concepts from Chapter 1 were most useful for analyzing your case?**
- Myth, ritual, sacred/ultimate, numinous?
- Ideal vs. lived?
- Functionalist vs. substantive approaches?
- Phenomenology's empathetic stance?
- Multiple belonging and blurred boundaries?

**2. What did your case reveal about the limitations of our frameworks?**
- Does the "world religions paradigm" fit?
- Are our categories (myth, ritual, belief) too rigid?
- Can phenomenology really "bracket" assumptions in complex cases?

**3. If you were writing a paper on your case study, what evidence would you need?**
- Primary sources (texts, interviews, observations)?
- Secondary sources (scholarly books, articles)?
- What questions would you want to ask practitioners?

**4. How does your case challenge or complicate simple narratives about religion?**

---

## **PRESENTATION GUIDELINES**

**When sharing with the class, your group should:**

1. **Briefly summarize your case** (30 seconds)
2. **Share ONE key insight** — What did you learn? What surprised you? What was tricky? (1 minute)
3. **Name one Chapter 1 concept that was especially helpful** for understanding your case

**Remember:** There are no perfectly "right" answers. Religious Studies is about asking good questions and analyzing thoughtfully, not arriving at settled conclusions.

## **INSTRUCTOR NOTES (Not for Students)**

**Pedagogical Goals:**
- Apply abstract concepts to concrete cases
- Practice using course vocabulary
- Develop analytical skills (not just memorization)
- Recognize complexity and ambiguity
- Build comfort with multiple valid perspectives

**Facilitation Tips:**
- Circulate during group work; listen for misunderstandings
- If a group finishes early, ask extension questions
- During debrief, affirm good insights even if reasoning is imperfect
- Use student responses to reinforce key concepts
- If a group struggles, scaffold: "Let's think about worldview — what questions does this practice address?"

**Alternative Use:**
These case studies can also be:
- Homework assignments (written analysis)
- Discussion board prompts
- Exam essay questions
- Basis for longer research papers

**Differentiation:**
- Advanced students: Add question about applying multiple theoretical lenses (Marx + Otto + Eliade)
- Struggling students: Focus on just questions 1-3; depth over breadth
- ESL students: Provide vocabulary list; allow extra time
