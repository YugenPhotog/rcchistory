                <h2>The Question</h2>
                <p>This is an excellent historical question that gets at something fundamental: political parties aren't static institutions—they're coalitions of people with shared interests, and when those coalitions change, so do the parties.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>The Short Answer</h2>
                <p>The Democratic Party transformed because <strong>the people inside it literally changed</strong>. The Jacksonian Democratic coalition (1820s-1860s) was Southern planters + Western settlers + urban workers. The modern Democratic coalition (1970s-2020s) is urban professionals + minorities + cultural-sector workers. Different humans, different values, different priorities.</p>
                
                <p>Four major drivers caused this transformation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Issue evolution</strong> — As new issues emerged (civil rights, environmentalism, feminism), parties reorganized around them</li>
                    <li><strong>Religious realignment</strong> — White evangelicals left the Democratic Party after Roe v. Wade (1973)</li>
                    <li><strong>Geographic shift</strong> — The "Solid South" flipped from Democratic to Republican (1960s-1990s)</li>
                    <li><strong>Educational polarization</strong> — College-educated voters increasingly Democratic; non-college increasingly Republican</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Going Deeper</h2>
                <p>Your course materials touch on the Jacksonian era—the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson championed westward expansion, Indian removal, and states' rights (particularly regarding slavery). This wasn't accidental: the party represented the interests of its coalition.</p>
                
                <p>But here's the key insight: <em>political parties aren't ideological movements—they're coalitions pursuing power.</em> When coalitions change, parties change.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Turning Points:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1860s:</strong> Republicans become the party of Union and emancipation; Democrats resist Reconstruction</li>
                    <li><strong>1930s:</strong> FDR's New Deal begins attracting urban immigrants, labor unions, and Northern African Americans</li>
                    <li><strong>1960s:</strong> Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act accelerate Southern white exodus from Democratic Party</li>
                    <li><strong>1970s-1980s:</strong> "Culture war" issues (abortion, religion, gender) complete the realignment</li>
                </ul>
