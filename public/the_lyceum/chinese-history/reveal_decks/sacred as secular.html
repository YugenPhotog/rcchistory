        <h2 class="tight">Fingarette’s Confucius</h2>
        <h3 class="tight">The Secular as Sacred</h3>
        <p class="muted">Final Lecture in our Confucianism Unit</p>
        <p class="small muted">PHIL 210 • World Religions</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          Today is our closing lecture for the Confucianism unit.
          The goal: use Herbert Fingarette’s interpretation to rethink what “religion” can mean.
          Emphasize: Confucius can be “religious” without looking like the Abrahamic template (God/creed/clergy).
        </aside>
      </section>

      <!-- Unit recap -->
      <section>
        <h3>Where We’ve Been (Quick Recap)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ren</strong> (humaneness): becoming fully human with others</li>
          <li><strong>li</strong> (ritual propriety): patterned action that shapes relationships</li>
          <li><strong>junzi</strong> (exemplary person): cultivated character made visible in conduct</li>
          <li>The <strong>Dao</strong> (“Way”) is learned through practice, not discovered in private</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="notes">
          Remind students: Confucianism is a training program for social life.
          It’s not “just ideas”—it’s a way to become a certain kind of person in community.
          Transition: Fingarette helps us see why ritual is central rather than decorative.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <!-- The puzzle -->
      <section>
        <h3>The Puzzle</h3>
        <p><strong>Student question:</strong> “Is Confucianism a religion or a philosophy?”</p>
        <p class="muted"><strong>Fingarette’s vibe:</strong> That question assumes a Western template.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          Explain the “template” students often import:
          Religion = belief in a supernatural realm + God + salvation + clergy + worship.
          Confucianism doesn’t center those things, so it can look “not religious” by that definition.
          Fingarette: you’re looking in the wrong place for the sacred.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <!-- Fingarette intro -->
      <section>
        <h3>Herbert Fingarette (1972)</h3>
        <p class="tight"><strong>Big claim:</strong> Confucius shows the sacred can be <em>enacted</em>, not just <em>believed</em>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No gods required for deep “religious” meaning</li>
          <li>Sacredness can arise inside disciplined human practice</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="notes">
          Keep biography minimal; focus on the interpretive shift.
          Fingarette isn’t saying “Confucius is atheist modern secular.”
          He’s saying “the secular can become sacred through ritualized action.”
        </aside>
      </section>

      <!-- Li as sacred performance -->
      <section>
        <h3>Core Concept: <em>li</em> as Sacred Performance</h3>
        <p class="tight"><strong>Ritual transforms ordinary actions into meaningful performances.</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>form</strong> of the act matters</li>
          <li>The act becomes “sacred” when done properly (attention + sincerity)</li>
          <li>Meaning isn’t only inside you—it’s in the shared ritual script</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="notes">
          Define li simply: patterned ways of acting that express AND create proper relationships.
          Clarify “sacred”: not “supernatural”; rather, reverence-worthy, meaning-making, reality-shaping.
          Emphasize shared recognition: both sides understand what kind of act this is.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <!-- Handshake -->
      <section>
        <h3>Fingarette’s Famous Example: The Handshake</h3>
        <div class="cols">
          <div class="col">
            <h4>Physical</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Two palms clasp</li>
              <li>Pressure + motion</li>
              <li>That’s all physics sees</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <h4>Ritual</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Greeting</li>
              <li>Respect</li>
              <li>Agreement</li>
              <li>Reconciliation</li>
              <li>“I recognize you.”</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="muted"><strong>Point:</strong> Meaning isn’t in the motion—it's in the recognized form.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          A handshake “works” because both people understand what it is and participate in it.
          Optional quick contrast: refusing a handshake changes the relationship immediately.
          Scale-up: Confucius treats a huge range of social behavior this way.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <!-- Scaling up -->
      <section>
        <h3>Scale Up: Confucius Applies This to Social Life</h3>
        <p class="tight">For Confucius, many everyday actions can function as <em>li</em>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Greeting elders / teachers</li>
          <li>Serving parents (and speaking properly)</li>
          <li>Hosting guests</li>
          <li>Mourning the dead</li>
          <li>Weddings / funerals</li>
          <li>Posture, timing, deference, restraint</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="muted"><strong>Everyday life becomes the arena of moral cultivation.</strong></p>

        <aside class="notes">
          Key contrast: Confucianism does not reserve sacredness for one day a week in a special building.
          Sacred meaning can be distributed across daily life—if actions are performed with reverence and form.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <!-- Magic -->
      <section>
        <h3>Fingarette’s Provocative Word: “Magic”</h3>
        <p class="tight"><strong>Not paranormal.</strong> “Magic” = ritual efficacy that changes social reality.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A wedding doesn’t only express love—it <strong>constitutes</strong> a marriage</li>
          <li>A funeral doesn’t only express grief—it <strong>re-situates</strong> the dead as an ancestor</li>
          <li>A bow doesn’t only show respect—it <strong>enacts</strong> a relationship</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="muted"><strong>No gods intervene—yet something real changes.</strong></p>

        <aside class="notes">
          Clarify: magic here means “things happen that can’t be explained just by mechanics.”
          It’s closer to “performative power”—actions that make something socially real by doing it.
          This is the heart of “secular as sacred.”
        </aside>
      </section>

      <!-- Not empty formalism -->
      <section>
        <h3>“Isn’t Ritual Fake?” (The Western Suspicion)</h3>
        <p class="tight"><strong>Confucian reply (via Fingarette):</strong> Form doesn’t kill sincerity—form can train sincerity.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Feelings alone are unstable</li>
          <li>Ritual disciplines attention and self-control</li>
          <li>Virtue becomes reliable through repeated practice</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="muted small">Analogy: music/sports—discipline and form enable authentic excellence.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          Many students equate authenticity with “whatever I feel in the moment.”
          Confucius: your feelings matter, but they need education and stability.
          Ritual is moral craftsmanship—training the self to become dependable for others.
        </aside>

      <!-- Confucian religiousness -->
      <section>
        <h3>Confucianism: Not Western Religion… Yet Religious</h3>
        <div class="cols">
          <div class="col">
            <h4>Not (narrow Western sense)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>No creator deity at the center</li>
              <li>No salvation doctrine</li>
              <li>No required priestly mediation</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <h4>Yet “religious” (broader sense)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Ultimate meaning through practice</li>
              <li>Reverence and seriousness</li>
              <li>Self-transformation</li>
              <li>Sacred bonds in community</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <aside class="notes">
          Offer a broad working definition:
          “Religious” practices structure ultimate meaning, cultivate reverence, and transform persons.
          Confucianism can do that without a salvation narrative or a personal God at the center.

      <!-- Immanent sacred -->
      <section>
        <h3>Immanent Sacredness</h3>
        <p class="tight"><strong>Immanent</strong> = “here, in this world,” not primarily “somewhere else.”</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Holiness appears in proper relationships</li>
          <li>The Way is learned in human interaction</li>
          <li>Moral order is lived—made real through conduct</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="muted"><strong>The sacred emerges through perfected secular action.</strong></p>

        <aside class="notes">
          Keep the vocabulary simple: immanent = here-and-now.
          Tie back to ren/li: humaneness becomes real through ritualized relational life.
          The sacred isn’t missing; it’s concentrated in ordinary life done well.

        <aside class="notes">
          Stress: heuristic, not stereotype.
          The point is category-expansion: sacred meaning can be built through practice, not only anchored in creed.

      <section>
        <h3>Criticisms & Limits (Scholarly Caution)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>May underplay transcendent elements (Heaven, spirits, sacrifice language)</li>
          <li>May overemphasize ritual form vs inner moral psychology</li>
          <li>Focuses on elite philosophical texts more than popular practice</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="muted"><strong>Balanced takeaway:</strong> best read as re-centering <em>li</em>, not denying all transcendence.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          Keep short but honest: scholars disagree about how “secular” Confucius is.
          Our use of Fingarette: a lens that makes li’s meaning-making power visible.
          You can accept the lens without making it the whole truth.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <!-- Final takeaway -->
      <section>
        <h3>Final Takeaway for the Unit</h3>
        <p class="tight">Confucianism challenges three common assumptions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Religion = belief in supernatural beings</li>
          <li>Ethics and religion are separate domains</li>
          <li>Ritual is the opposite of sincerity</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Fingarette’s insight:</strong> the sacred can be something we <em>do</em>—together—through disciplined, reverent practice.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          Deliver this as the closing thesis.
          Reinforce: Confucius is a philosopher of sacred everyday life.
          The “holy” is not primarily elsewhere; it’s in human relations done right.

        <p class="tight"><strong>Where do you see “secular-as-sacred” rituals in modern life?</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Graduations</li>

          Encourage concrete examples.
          Push them to notice: even “non-religious” modern life is filled with meaning-making rituals.

      <!-- Exit ticket -->
      <section>
        <h3>Exit Ticket (1–2 minutes)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Define “secular as sacred” in your own words.</li>
          <li>Give one modern ritual that <em>creates</em> meaning (not just expresses it).</li>
          <li>Why might someone dismiss ritual as “empty”? How does Fingarette respond?</li>
