## SLIDE 2

# Constantine and Christianization

- Constantine emperor 306–337  
- 312: Vision "In this sign, you will conquer"  
- 313: Edict of Milan – toleration and imperial support  
- Christianity becomes favored, then state religion  
- Desire for **"One God, one Church, one Emperor"**  
- Need for unified doctrine (orthodoxy)

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Chi-Rho symbol and Constantine's vision]

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Ask what happens when a persecuted minority becomes aligned with imperial power.

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**  
> Turning point! Christianity goes from illegal to official in one generation.

---

## SLIDE 3

# Creation of Orthodoxy

- 325: Council of Nicaea – first ecumenical council  
- Goal: unify worldwide church; produce Nicene Creed (revised 381)  
- Creeds define correct teaching (orthodoxy)  
- Alternative theories labeled **heresy** and may be punished  
- Heresy becomes both religious and political crime  

[WARNING_BOX: "Orthodoxy" = right belief; "Heresy" = wrong choice]

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Important nuance: Many "heretics" thought they were defending biblical truth.

---

## SLIDE 4

# The Council System

## How Councils Work:
1. Emperor or Pope calls bishops together
2. Debate theological questions
3. Vote on official positions
4. Produce creeds or canons
5. Condemn opposing views

## Major Early Councils:
- Nicaea (325) - Trinity, divinity of Christ
- Constantinople (381) - Holy Spirit, revised creed
- Ephesus (431) - Mary as Theotokos
- Chalcedon (451) - Two natures of Christ

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Don't drown students in names—emphasize that doctrine emerges through conflict and compromise.

---

## SLIDE 5

# [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## Quick Check

1. What changed for Christianity with Constantine's conversion?

2. **Think-Pair-Share:** Why would an emperor care about religious unity? What are the political implications?

3. Define in your own words:
   - Orthodoxy
   - Heresy
   - Ecumenical council

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**  
> Remember: Orthodox vs. heretical is about power and authority, not just theology.

## SLIDE 6

# Major Christian "Heresies" (Competing Theologies)

[POPUP: Why "Heresies" in Quotes?]
These were serious theological positions held by educated Christians. "Heresy" is the winner's label for the loser's theology.

## The Central Question:
**Who is Jesus? How can he be both God and human?**

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Frame these as good-faith attempts to solve the God-man problem, not just "wrong" ideas.

---

## SLIDE 7

# Arianism

- **Arius:** Jesus is "begotten," therefore not fully God in same sense as Father  
- Jesus and God are of *like* substance, not the same substance  
- Denies full divinity of Christ  
- Brief ascendancy, then condemned

[GRID_COMPARISON:
Orthodox Position | Arian Position
Jesus eternally God | Jesus created by God
Same substance as Father | Similar to Father
Fully divine | Greatest creation]

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**  
> Arianism seems logical: if Jesus is "Son," he must come after Father, right? Orthodoxy says no—eternal generation.

---

## SLIDE 8

# Other Major Controversies

## Docetism
- From Greek *dokein* – "to seem"  
- Jesus only appeared to have real human body  
- Often linked with Gnosticism (matter evil, spirit good)  

## Monophysitism
- "One nature" – Christ has only one nature (divine OR human, not both)

## Monarchianism
- Emphasizes unity of God  
- **Adoptionism:** Jesus a man adopted by God  
- **Patripassianism:** Father himself suffers as Son  

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Each position "protects" some aspect of God/Christ but creates new problems.

---

## SLIDE 9

# The Nicene Creed as Response

Key phrases directly target heresies:

> "Begotten, not made, of one being with the Father"  
[Targets: Arianism]

> "Was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became truly human"  
[Targets: Docetism]

> "True God from true God"  
[Targets: Adoptionism]

[POPUP: Creed as Boundary]
The creed draws lines: inside = orthodox, outside = heretical

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Activity idea: have students match creed phrases to the heresies they counter.

---

## SLIDE 10

# St Augustine (354–430)

- Most influential Western theologian  
- Shaped medieval and later Christianity  
- Major works:  
  - *Confessions* (spiritual autobiography)
  - *City of God* (response to Rome's fall)
  
## Key Ideas:
- **Original Sin** - humanity inherently corrupted
- **Divine Grace** - only God's gift enables salvation
- Predestination debates begin

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Draw a line from Augustine's views to later Protestant–Catholic debates.

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**  
> Augustine = foundation for Western Christianity's focus on sin, grace, and God's sovereignty.

## [SECTION] East and West Divide

## SLIDE 11

# Byzantine Christianity Emerges

- Constantine moves capital to Constantinople (330)
- Western empire falls (476); Eastern continues 1000+ years  
- Bishop of Constantinople = *primus inter pares* ("first among equals")  
- Cultural differences:
  - West: Latin language, Roman law
  - East: Greek language, Greek philosophy

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Map showing Eastern and Western Roman Empires]

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Clarify that Orthodoxy and Catholicism share early creeds but diverge institutionally and culturally.

---

## SLIDE 12

# Iconoclasm Controversy

- Emperor Leo III orders destruction of icons (726)
- Motivations:
  - Muslim criticism of image worship
  - Biblical prohibition concerns
- Western Pope defends images
- Eastern councils divided
- **Second Council of Nicaea** (787) affirms icon use
- Deepens East–West tensions

[GRID_COMPARISON:
Iconoclasts | Iconophiles
Images = idolatry | Images = windows to heaven
Spiritual worship only | Material aids devotion
Old Testament prohibition | Incarnation sanctifies matter]

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Use this to explore how images function in worship and identity.

---

## SLIDE 13

# [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## Analytical Exercise

1. **Create a Chart:** List three heresies, what they taught, and why orthodoxy rejected them.

2. **DISCUSSION_PROMPT:** How do the iconoclast controversies reflect deeper differences between Eastern and Western Christianity?

3. **Critical Thinking:** Who decides what is "orthodox"? What gives them that authority?

---

## SLIDE 14

# The Great Schism (1054)

## Filioque Controversy
- Western church adds *filioque* ("and the Son") to creed
- States Holy Spirit proceeds from Father AND Son
- East: Only ecumenical councils can change creed
- West: Pope has authority to clarify doctrine

## The Break
- 1054: Mutual excommunications
- Cardinal Humbert and Patriarch Michael I
- Schism becomes permanent
- Two churches: Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Emphasize both theology and politics in the split.

---

## [SECTION] Reformation Revolution

---

## SLIDE 15

# Medieval Church Corruption

- Church wealthy, powerful, entangled with monarchies
- Revenue sources:
  - Land ownership
  - Tithes (10% tax)
  - Forced labor (corvée)
  - Papal States
- Land rich but cash poor
- 1517: Pope Leo X offers indulgences for St. Peter's

[WARNING_BOX: Indulgence = payment to reduce punishment for sins]

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Be explicit: corruption + spiritual anxiety created fertile ground for reform.

---

## SLIDE 16

# Martin Luther's Challenge

- German monk, wealthy family
- Doctor of Theology, Bible professor
- Troubled by indulgence sales
- October 31, 1517: posts **95 Theses** in Wittenberg
- Intended for academic debate, sparked revolution

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Luther posting theses on church door]

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Clarify that Luther didn't initially aim to split the church; he sought academic debate.

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**  
> Remember the date: October 31, 1517. Reformation begins!

---

## SLIDE 17

# Luther's New Theology

## Three "Solas":
1. **Sola gratia** – salvation by grace alone  
2. **Sola fide** – justified by faith alone, not works  
3. **Sola scriptura** – Scripture alone as authority  

## Revolutionary Implications:
- Rejects papal/church authority
- Questions seven sacraments
- Promotes "priesthood of all believers"
- Bible in vernacular languages
- Reduces sacraments to two: Baptism and Eucharist

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Link these principles to later Protestant denominations.

## SLIDE 18

# [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## Day 2 Summary Activity

**Create a Timeline:** Mark these key events and explain their significance:
- 313 (Edict of Milan)
- 325 (Council of Nicaea)  
- 1054 (Great Schism)
- 1517 (95 Theses)

**Reflection Question:** How does Christianity change when it gains political power? Give specific examples from today's material.

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**  
> See the pattern? Unity→Division→Reform→More Division
