[SECTION: Introduction to Judaism]

## SLIDE 1: The Name "Judaism" and Related Terms

### Judaism

- Historic religion of the people variously known as:  
  - **Hebrews**  
  - **Israelites**  
  - **Jews**  
- Descendants of the patriarchs of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament):  
  - Abraham  
  - Isaac  
  - Jacob (also called **Israel**)  
- Judaism is an example of an **ethnic religion**:  
  - Tied to a particular people as well as a religious tradition

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Make sure students see that "Jewish" can refer to religion, ethnicity, culture, or all three. Ask them why that complicates simple categories like "religion" vs "people."

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Remember: Judaism = both religion AND ethnicity. This is different from Christianity or Islam which are universal religions not tied to a specific ethnic group.

---

## SLIDE 2: The Jewish Present as Shaped by Its Past

### Key Framework for Understanding Judaism

Contemporary Jewish life is unintelligible without understanding:
- **Covenant** - Sacred agreements with God
- **Land** - Connection to Israel/Palestine
- **Exile** - Diaspora experience
- **Torah** - Sacred law and teaching
- **Persecution** - Historical challenges

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Use this heading to frame the rest of the lecture: contemporary Jewish life is unintelligible without covenant, land, exile, Torah, and persecution.

[SECTION: Creation and Early Narratives]

## SLIDE 3: From the Creation to Abraham (ca. 2000 BCE)

### Creation Myths (Genesis 1–2)

- God referred to as **Elohim** and **YHWH Elohim**  
- Six-day creation pattern:  
  - Light  
  - Waters and firmament  
  - Land and vegetation  
  - Sun, moon, stars  
  - Animals  
  - Humanity  
- Humanity created in **God's image** (*Imago Dei*)  
- Establishment of **Sabbath** rest

[WARNING_BOX: Using "myth" here does **not** mean "false." It means sacred narrative about origins.]

---

## SLIDE 4: The Great Flood: Divine Judgment and Mercy

- Humanity's corruption leads to decision for a great flood
- **Noah** chosen because of his righteousness
- The flood functions as a **reset** of creation
- Noah and his family preserved in the ark
- Afterward, God establishes a **covenant with Noah**
- **Rainbow** given as sign of divine mercy and promise not to destroy the world by flood again

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Connect this story to covenant patterns and to ancient Near Eastern flood myths (if you have time).

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Notice the pattern: human failure → divine judgment → divine mercy → covenant. This pattern repeats throughout Jewish scripture.

---

## SLIDE 5: [ASSESSMENT_BREAK] Check Your Understanding

### Quick Review Questions:

1. **What makes Judaism an "ethnic religion"?**
   - [POPUP: It is tied to a particular people (Jewish ethnicity) as well as religious tradition]

2. **What does "myth" mean in religious studies?**
   - [POPUP: Sacred narrative about origins, NOT "false story"]

3. **What sign did God give Noah after the flood?**
   - [POPUP: The rainbow - as promise never to destroy earth by flood again]

[DISCUSSION_PROMPT: "How might being both an ethnicity AND a religion affect Jewish identity differently than purely universal religions like Christianity or Islam?"]

---

[SECTION: The Abrahamic Covenant]

## SLIDE 6: Covenant People

### The Foundation of Jewish Identity

- **Genesis 17:7** – God promises to establish a covenant with Abram and his descendants
- History of Judaism begins with **Abram/Abraham** and God's covenant
- "Covenant" literally means a **contract** or agreement
  - In the Bible: a two-way promise between God and His people

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Have students identify basic covenant elements: parties, terms, sign, promises, consequences.

---

## SLIDE 7: Chosen People

### Divine Election and Responsibility

- **Deuteronomy 10:15** emphasizes divine choice:  
  - God "set His affection" on the ancestors  
  - God "chose their descendants after them… above all peoples"  
- "People" = Judaism is both a **religion and an ethnicity**  
- **Chosenness** brings a **call to be holy**, not privilege without responsibility  
- Idea of being chosen has helped Jews sustain their identity through a long and difficult history

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Ask: What are the possible dangers and gifts of believing you are "chosen"?

---

## SLIDE 8: Abrahamic Covenant - The Call

### The Call and Theophany

- **Genesis 17:1–2** – God appears to Abram and calls him into covenant
- **Theophany** = a visible manifestation of God to human beings

### "Cutting" the Covenant

- **Genesis 15:9–10; Jeremiah 34:18** – covenant symbolized by cutting animals
- Ancient practice of "cutting" a covenant underscores its seriousness

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Ancient covenant-making ceremony illustration]

---

## SLIDE 9: Terms of the Abrahamic Covenant

### Terms of the Covenant (Gen 17:1–8)

**Abraham and his descendants are to:**  
- Worship, believe, and obey God  
- Walk "before God" and be "blameless"  

**God promises to:**  
- Be God to Abraham and his descendants  
- Give them the land where Abraham is a stranger  
- Make Abraham "father of many nations"  
- Abram's name changed to **Abraham** to mark new status

---

## SLIDE 10: Token and Blessings of the Covenant

### Token and Blessings (Gen 17:11–12)

- **Circumcision** of every male as sign of the covenant

**Blessings include:**  
- **Posterity** – exceedingly fruitful, nations and kings from him  
- **Land** – a homeland for his descendants  
- **Protection** – God as shield  
- **Universal blessing** – "in you and in your descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed"

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Stress how covenant theology underlies later ideas about land, law, and messiah.

## SLIDE 11: [ASSESSMENT_BREAK] Covenant Analysis

[GRID_COMPARISON:
| Covenant Element | Noah | Abraham |
|-----------------|------|----------|
| Sign | Rainbow | Circumcision |
| Promise from God | Never flood again | Land, descendants, blessing |
| Human obligation | Be fruitful, don't shed blood | Walk before God, be blameless |
| Scope | All humanity | Abraham's descendants |]

**Think-Pair-Share:** What do these covenants tell us about the Jewish understanding of God's relationship with humanity?

---

[SECTION: Formation of Ancient Israel]

## SLIDE 12: Patriarchal Order

### Transmission of the Covenant

- Covenant passes **from father to son**
- **Patriarchal primogeniture** – the firstborn son normally inherits leadership
- Jacob's twelve sons become ancestors of the **twelve tribes of Israel**
- Story of **Joseph** explains how the family ends up in Egypt

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Note that primogeniture is often subverted (Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over Esau), which is itself a theological statement.

## SLIDE 13: The Emergence of Ancient Israel (ca. 1200–950 BCE)

### Exodus and Enslavement in Egypt

Book of **Exodus** narrates:
- Israel's enslavement in Egypt
- God's call to **Moses** to lead them out
- Pharaoh's resistance
- Escape through parted waters of the **Red Sea**

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Mention that the historicity of the Exodus is debated; emphasize what the story does theologically for Israel's identity.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** The Exodus is THE foundational story for Jewish identity—referenced constantly in prayers, holidays, and ethics.

---

## SLIDE 14: Significance of the Exodus

### The Exodus Creates Israel as a People

The Exodus is absolutely central for understanding Jewish religious identity:

- **Unification** – forms a single people out of tribes
- **People creation** – Israel becomes a nation under God
- **Covenant relationship re-established** – God renews covenant at Sinai
- **Law of Moses instituted** – **Torah** given
- **Tabernacle (Tent-Temple)** constructed:
  - Sacred space for Israelite worship
  - Houses the **Ark of the Covenant**
- Wilderness period **purges older generation** (including Moses) before entry into land
- Israel learns **utter dependence on God** for food, water, and guidance
- Monotheism reasserted and strengthened

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Connect Exodus themes to later Jewish holidays, especially Passover.

---

## SLIDE 15: The First Temple Period (ca. 952–586 BCE)

### From Wandering to Kingdom

- After Moses, **Joshua** leads Israelites into **Canaan** (late 13th to early 12th c. BCE)
- Land divided among tribes and initially ruled by **Judges**
- Later, Israelites adopt **monarchy**:
  - Saul
  - David
  - Solomon
- **Solomon** builds the first permanent **Temple** to replace the Tabernacle
- Temple centralizes worship in **Jerusalem**

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Artist's reconstruction of Solomon's Temple]

---

## SLIDE 16: Division and Exile

### Division of the Kingdom

After Solomon's death, kingdom divides:
- **Israel (North)** – ten tribes
- **Judah (South)** – tribes of Judah and Benjamin

### Assyrian Exile

- 722 BCE: **Assyrian Empire** conquers northern kingdom of Israel
- Population displaced and mixed with others ("Lost Ten Tribes")
- Kingdom of Judah survives as a **vassal state**, paying tribute

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Draw a simple map showing North/South split and emphasize how political events reshape religious life.

---

## SLIDE 17: [ASSESSMENT_BREAK] Timeline Review

### Put these events in chronological order:

1. Division of the Kingdom
2. Abraham's covenant
3. Exodus from Egypt
4. Solomon builds the Temple
5. Assyrian conquest of Israel (North)
6. Noah's flood

[POPUP: Correct order: 6, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5]

**Reflection Question:** How do these historical events shape Jewish identity and practice today?

---

## SLIDE 18: Day 1 Summary

1. **Judaism as Ethnic Religion**
   - Both a people and a faith tradition
   - "Jewish" = religious, ethnic, and cultural identity

2. **Covenant Theology**
   - Central organizing principle
   - Creates mutual obligations between God and people

3. **Sacred History**
   - From creation through monarchy
   - Each era adds layers to Jewish identity

4. **Foundation Stories Matter**
   - Exodus creates the people
   - Temple centralizes worship
   - Exile begins diaspora experience

**Next Class:** We'll explore the Second Temple period, the development of rabbinic Judaism, and core Jewish teachings about God and ethics.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** For your notes: Judaism = Covenant People + Sacred History + Ethical Monotheism. Everything else builds on these foundations!
