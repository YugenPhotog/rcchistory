# Day 3: Modern Movements and Global Christianity

## Today's Focus:
- Catholic Counter-Reformation

- Vatican II revolution
- Core doctrines (Trinity)
- Contemporary worship and ethics

---

## [SECTION] Catholic Response to Reformation

---

## SLIDE 2

# Catholic Counter-Reformation

- Internal reform AND response to Protestants
- Pope Paul III initiates renewal
- Two-pronged approach:
  1. Reform abuses
  2. Clarify and defend doctrine

[POPUP: Not Just "Counter"]
The Catholic Reformation included genuine spiritual renewal, not just opposing Protestants

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Stress that Trent reaffirms Catholic distinctives, not a compromise council.

---

## SLIDE 3

# Council of Trent (1545-1563)

## Key Outcomes:
- **Doctrinal Clarifications:**
  - Transubstantiation affirmed
  - Seven sacraments maintained  
  - Scripture AND tradition as authorities
  - Justification by faith AND works

- **Practical Reforms:**
  - Seminary education for priests
  - Residence requirements for bishops
  - End of indulgence abuses
  - Standardized Mass (Tridentine)

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**  
> Trent = Catholic Christianity doubling down on what makes it distinct from Protestantism.

## SLIDE 4

# New Instruments of Reform

## Society of Jesus (Jesuits)
- Founded 1534 by Ignatius of Loyola  
- Special vow of obedience to Pope

[WARNING_BOX: The Inquisition shows the dark side of enforcing religious unity]

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Use this to open questions about faith, authority, and inquiry.

## SLIDE 5

# Protestant Proliferation

## After Luther, "Floodgates Open":
- **John Calvin** → Reformed tradition
- **Huldrych Zwingli** → Swiss Reformation  
- **Anglican Church** → Church of England
- **Anabaptists** → Radical Reformation
- Eventual result: thousands of denominations

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Tree diagram showing Protestant denominational families]

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> You don't need exact numbers; emphasize fragmentation and diversity.

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**  
> Once you challenge central authority, who decides what's true? Every group can claim to follow the Bible.

## SLIDE 6

# [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## Comparative Analysis

1. **Chart Creation:** Compare Catholic and Protestant positions on:
   - Authority (Pope vs. Scripture alone)
   - Salvation (Faith + Works vs. Faith alone)
   - Sacraments (Seven vs. Two)

2. **DISCUSSION_PROMPT:** Was the Protestant Reformation inevitable? Why or why not?

3. What were the positive and negative consequences of the Counter-Reformation?

## SLIDE 7

# Fundamentalism Movement

  5. Imminent Second Coming

## Cultural Impact:
- Opposition to evolution in schools (1920s)
- Creation of Bible institutes
- Radio/TV evangelism
- Political mobilization (1970s-present)

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Stress that "fundamentalist" has both historical meaning and modern pejorative use; define historically.

---

## SLIDE 8

# Ecumenical Movement

## Goals:

- Promote Christian unity
- Cooperative mission work

## Key Developments:
- **World Council of Churches** (1948)

[POPUP: "Ecumenical" = promoting worldwide Christian unity]

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**

---

## SLIDE 9

# Second Vatican Council (1962-1965)

## Revolutionary Changes:

[GRID_COMPARISON:
Pre-Vatican II | Post-Vatican II
Latin Mass | Local languages
Priest's back to people | Facing congregation  
Laity passive | Active participation
Rigid hierarchy | Shared responsibility
Other religions false | Seeds of truth acknowledged]

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Show "before and after" examples (Latin vs vernacular liturgy).

## [SECTION] Core Teachings and the Trinity

---

## SLIDE 11

# [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## Modern Movements Review

1. Compare and contrast fundamentalism and ecumenism as responses to modernity.

2. **Small Group Discussion:** How did Vatican II change the experience of ordinary Catholics? Would your grandparents recognize today's Mass?

3. Why might young Protestants be attracted to ancient monastic practices?

---

## SLIDE 12

# Common Teachings: The Trinity

## Historical Development:

- Early Christians wrestle with: One God + Father + Son + Spirit
- 4th-5th century councils codify doctrine

## Core Affirmation:
**One God in three persons, one substance**

[WARNING_BOX: This is mystery, not math! 1+1+1=1, not 3]

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Make clear the difference between biblical language and later doctrinal formulation.

## Final Synthesis

**Choose ONE prompt for a 5-minute written reflection:**

1. Trace one theme (authority, salvation, or worship) through all three days of our Christianity study. How has it evolved?

2. How do the historical divisions we studied (East-West, Catholic-Protestant) still impact Christianity today?

3. Based on our study, what might Christianity look like in 50 years? Consider demographics, theology, and practice.

**Be prepared to share insights with a partner.**

## SLIDE 19

# Chapter Summary: Christianity's Journey

## Three Key Threads:

1. **Questions about Jesus's identity** shaped doctrine
   - Jewish Messiah → Universal Savior
   - Human teacher → God incarnate

2. **Questions about authority** shaped institutions  
   - Apostles → Bishops → Pope/Councils/Scripture

3. **Questions about holiness** shaped practice
   - Jewish law → Grace → Diverse expressions

## One Faith, Many Expressions:
From 12 disciples to 2.4 billion believers across thousands of denominations

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> End by tying together the three days, showing how each era's struggles shape today's Christianity.

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**  
> Remember: Unity in essentials (creeds), diversity in non-essentials (worship styles), charity in all things!
