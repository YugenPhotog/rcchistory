## SLIDE 1: New Religious Movements and Their Other Names

### What Are New Religious Movements?

- **New Religious Movements (NRMs)**  
  - Arose in modern times.  
  - Have sufficient size, longevity, and impact to merit academic study.

### Other Labels (and Their Problems)

- **Sect**  
  - A new and relatively small group that has emerged from an established or larger religion.

- **Cult**  
  - A religious group that is seen as extreme in its dedication to its beliefs.  
  - **Not an academic term**; often used as an insult for groups outside the mainstream.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Make a big deal out of the word "cult" being polemical, not neutral. Encourage students to use "NRM" or "movement" in class discussion.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Remember: "Cult" = insulting term, not academic. Always use "NRM" (New Religious Movement) in your papers and discussions!

## SLIDE 2: Common Doctrines in NRMs

- **Apocalyptic**  
  - Belief that the world will end soon and be replaced by a perfect or transformed society.

- **Millenarianism**  
  - Belief in a thousand-year reign of peace on earth near the end of time.

- **New Age**  
  - Eclectic beliefs and practices.  
  - Aim to bring the individual to a state of higher consciousness or spiritual awakening.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Give at least one concrete example for each category (e.g., Millerites/Adventists for apocalyptic, some New Age healing circles, etc.).

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Three common NRM patterns: Apocalyptic (world ending soon), Millenarian (1000-year peace), New Age (higher consciousness).

---

## SLIDE 3: Significant NRMs in the United States

- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS / Mormonism)  
- Seventh-day Adventists  
- Jehovah's Witnesses  
- Scientology

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Clarify that only some of these are viewed as "controversial" in popular culture, but all fit the NRM pattern historically.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** We'll focus especially on Mormonism and Scientology as case studies, but all four show similar patterns of development.

---

## [SECTION] Historical Context: 19th Century America

## SLIDE 4: Religion in the Jacksonian Age

- Democratization of religion.  
- Separation of church and state widens space for new groups.  
- Emphasis on appeal to **ordinary people**.  
- "Plain words from the heart" rather than elaborate theology.  
- Rejection of strong Calvinist predestination; focus on **individual choice and destiny**.  
- Period of intense religious revival and experimentation.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Connect this to broader Jacksonian themes: expanding suffrage, suspicion of elites, frontier culture.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Jacksonian era = common people's religion. No fancy theology needed, just sincere belief. This opens door for new movements!

---

## SLIDE 5: The Second Great Awakening (1790s–1830s)

- Period of intense religious revival.  
- Characterized by **camp meetings**.  
- Camp meeting revivals emphasized:  
  - Intensely personal religious experience.  
  - Sudden conversion ("getting saved").  
- Many new movements and denominations were organized from this revivalist energy.

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Historical illustration of a camp meeting revival with crowds gathered outdoors]

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Help students see that the same environment that produces new denominations also produces NRMs—lots of fluidity and innovation.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Second Great Awakening = religious marketplace. Everyone's starting new churches and movements. Perfect conditions for NRMs!

## [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## SLIDE 6: Quick Check - Understanding Context

**DISCUSSION_PROMPT:** 
In pairs, discuss: How might the democratization of religion and the Second Great Awakening create conditions favorable to new religious movements? Share one insight with the class.

**Time:** 3 minutes discussion, 2 minutes sharing

## [SECTION] Approaching NRMs Academically

## SLIDE 7: Three Rules of Religious Understanding (Krister Stendahl)

1. When trying to understand another religion, **ask the adherents** of that religion, not its enemies.  
2. Don't compare **your best** to **their worst**.  
3. Leave room for **"holy envy"** – recognize elements in other religions that you admire or wish could be reflected in your own tradition.

[WARNING_BOX: These rules are especially important when studying controversial NRMs]

**SPEAKER NOTES:** You can adopt these as ground rules for the whole course. They are especially helpful when discussing contested NRMs like Mormonism and Scientology.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** MEMORIZE these three rules! They'll guide our whole study of NRMs and help avoid bias.

## [SECTION] Case Study 1: The LDS Church - Origins

## SLIDE 8: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormonism)

### Joseph Smith: Early Life

- Born 1805 into a poor farming family in Vermont.  
- Family forced to sell farm after a failed business deal.  
- 1816: Smith family moves to **Palmyra, New York**.  
- Lives by manual labor; Joseph has **little formal education**.  

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Emphasize Smith's marginal social status—poor, little schooling, frontier context—contrasting with the sophistication of the movement that arises.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Joseph Smith = poor farm boy, little education. Classic example of Jacksonian "common man" religious leader.

---

## SLIDE 9: The First Vision

- As a young teen, Joseph is caught in the crosscurrents of revivals in western New York ("Burned-over District").  
- Troubled about religion, he reads: "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God…"  
- Prays for guidance → reports a visionary experience (the **First Vision**).  
- Claims to see divine personages who tell him existing churches are in error and he should not join any of them.  

[POPUP: "Burned-over District" = region of intense revival activity in western New York]

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** First Vision = foundational event for LDS. Joseph sees God and Jesus as separate beings, told not to join any church.

---

## SLIDE 10: Significance of the First Vision

Central to LDS theology; LDS is a Christian sect but with significant differences from other Christian churches:

- **Nature of the Godhead**  
  - Godhead is three separate, distinct personages (Father, Son, Holy Ghost).  
  - Rejection of classical doctrine of the **Trinity**.

- **Apostasy and Restoration**  
  - Historic Christian creeds and churches seen as products of a **Great Apostasy**.  
  - Joseph Smith called as prophet to restore the "true" Church.

- **Continuing Revelation**  
  - Rejection of a **closed canon**; God can and does reveal new scripture and guidance.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Be precise: Latter-day Saints see themselves as Christian but believe that they restore original Christianity. Many other Christians dispute this; present it descriptively, not as a debate to settle in class.

---

## SLIDE 11: Theophany

- **Theophany** = visible manifestation or appearance of a deity.  
- The First Vision is understood by Latter-day Saints as a theophany.

[POPUP: Compare to Moses and the burning bush, or Paul on the road to Damascus]

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Good vocabulary moment—help students distinguish "vision," "revelation," and "theophany."

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Vocabulary alert! Theophany = when God appears visibly to someone. Big deal in religious history.

---

## SLIDE 12: Angel Moroni and the Gold Plates

- Turning point in 1823: Joseph prays at night, troubled by his sins.  
- He experiences a vision of a personage in brilliant light.  
- The figure identifies himself as **Moroni**, a resurrected being.  
- Moroni speaks of a record written on plates, buried in a nearby hill.  
- Plates contain the religious history of ancient peoples in the Americas.  
- Joseph is eventually commanded to retrieve and translate them.

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Artist's depiction of Angel Moroni appearing to Joseph Smith]

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Make clear that the gold plates themselves are no longer available; this is central to debates about historicity.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Moroni = angel/resurrected being who shows Joseph where to find golden plates with ancient American scripture.

## [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## SLIDE 13: Concept Application

**GRID_COMPARISON:**
| Concept | Traditional Christianity | LDS Teaching |
|---------|-------------------------|--------------|
| Nature of God | Trinity (3 in 1) | Three separate beings |
| Scripture | Closed canon | Open canon |
| Authority | Ancient tradition | Modern restoration |

**Question:** How do these differences reflect the democratizing spirit of Jacksonian America?

---

## SLIDE 14: The Book of Mormon

- First uniquely American scripture produced by a Christian NRM.  
- Structured similarly to the Bible (books and chapters).  
- Martin Harris called it the "Mormon Bible"; critics called it the "Gold Bible."  
- Claims to record roughly **1,000 years** of primarily religious history in the Western Hemisphere.  
- Narrates:  
  - Wars and the fall of civilizations.  
  - Rise of prophets and reformers.  
  - Conversions and apostasies.  
  - A visit of the resurrected **Jesus Christ** to the Americas.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Book of Mormon = American scripture about ancient American civilizations. Includes Jesus visiting Americas after resurrection.

---

## SLIDE 15: Christian Message of the Book of Mormon

- Strongly Christ-centered; anchors Mormonism to Christianity.  
- Many doctrinal innovations, yet retains core Christian themes of:  
  - Faith in Christ.  
  - Repentance.  
  - Grace.  

A representative passage:

> "Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind, and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ…"

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Invite students to read excerpts, not summaries, so they can see why believers find it spiritually compelling regardless of their views on historical claims.

## [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## SLIDE 16: Day 1 Synthesis

**DISCUSSION_PROMPT:**
Using Stendahl's three rules, how should we approach studying the origins of Mormonism? What questions would you want to ask a believing Latter-day Saint about their faith?

**Homework Preview:** 
- Read pages on early Mormon community building
- Consider: How do NRMs create and maintain community identity?

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Remember to apply Stendahl's rules! Ask believers, don't compare best to worst, leave room for holy envy.
