## SLIDE 1
# The Devotional Period (600 CE–Present)

## [SECTION] Islam's Influence and Hindu Response

### Historical Context
- Long-standing **trade** between India and Arabia.
- After rise of **Islam** (7th century), Arab traders bring Islam into India.
- **Delhi Sultanate** emerges in 1206 CE following military campaigns, trade, and cultural exchange.
- Synthesis of **Islamic** and **Indian** civilizations.
- India becomes part of a larger **world-system**.
- Early **16th century**: Central Asian Muslim rulers form the **Mughal dynasty**.
- By **1700**, the Mughals control almost the entire subcontinent.

<aside class="notes">
External pressure provokes both assimilation and creative renewal. Islam's presence spurs Hindu theological development, particularly bhakti movements.
</aside>

---

## SLIDE 2
## Dual Influence of Islam

Islam's presence in India:
- Encourages **conversion** to Islam among some.
- Encourages **monotheistic and egalitarian trends** among Hindus.
- Contributes to the rise of:
  - **Sikhism** (see ch. 6).
  - New **devotional (bhakti)** movements.

**Results for Hinduism:**
- Stronger emphasis on devotion to one chosen deity
- Development of sant tradition (poet-saints)
- Some movement toward social reform
- Interfaith dialogue and synthesis (Kabir, Guru Nanak)

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Notice how traditions influence each other - Hinduism responds to Islamic monotheism while maintaining its own character.

## SLIDE 3
# The Bhagavad Gita – Setting the Scene

## [SECTION] Scripture as Ethical Guide

- Part of the **Mahabharata** epic (world's longest poem: ~100,000 verses)
- Presents a dialogue between Prince **Arjuna** and **Krishna** (his charioteer, revealed as divine)
- Set on the eve of a great battle between cousins (Pandavas vs. Kauravas)
- Functions as a **"gospel"** within the epic
- Addresses universal questions through a specific dilemma

### The Gita's Structure:
- **18 chapters**, ~700 verses (shlokas)
- **Three main sections** (scholars debate exact divisions):
  1. **Chapters 1-6**: Karma Yoga (action without attachment)
  2. **Chapters 7-12**: Bhakti Yoga (devotion to Krishna)
  3. **Chapters 13-18**: Jnana Yoga (knowledge of reality)
- **Chapter 11** (middle): Krishna's divine revelation—theological turning point
- **Final chapter (18)**: Synthesis of all paths

**Genre:** Philosophical dialogue + devotional scripture + ethical manual

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: "Arjuna Krishna battlefield Kurukshetra Bhagavad Gita chariot"]

<aside class="notes">
Set up dramatic tension - this isn't abstract philosophy but ethics in life-or-death situation. Gita composed ~400 BCE-400 CE, part of larger epic tradition.
</aside>

## SLIDE 4
## Arjuna's Dilemma

Question: **To fight or not to fight?**

**The Conflict:**
- As a warrior (kshatriya), his **dharma** is to fight.
- But fighting his own kin threatens to:
  - Destroy families.
  - Undermine social and moral order.
  - Violate **ahimsa** (non-harm).
- If he fights, he violates one set of moral demands
- If he refuses, he violates another
- Arjuna prefers to **lay down his weapons and die** rather than fight (Gita 1:47).

**The Paralysis:**
- "My limbs sink, my mouth is parched, my body trembles"
- "I see no good in killing my kinsmen"
- **Moral paralysis**: When all choices seem wrong

[DISCUSSION_PROMPT: Have you ever faced a situation where any choice seemed wrong? How did you decide?]

<aside class="notes">
Case study in conflict of duties (deontological ethics). Very relatable for students. Compare to Sophie's Choice, trolley problem, wartime ethical dilemmas.
</aside>

---

## SLIDE 5
# [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## Ethical Dilemma Analysis

**Small Group Exercise (8 minutes):**
1. List all of Arjuna's obligations (to family, caste, kingdom, dharma)
2. Identify which obligations conflict
3. What would YOU advise Arjuna to do?
4. What ethical frameworks (from your experience) could help?

**Share Out:** Each group presents their analysis (2 min each)

<aside class="notes">
Expected answers: Family duty vs. warrior duty vs. non-harm vs. social order. Most groups struggle—no clear answer. This sets up Krishna's radical solution.
</aside>

---

## SLIDE 6
# Krishna Instructs Arjuna

Krishna's Initial Arguments:
- Arjuna must **fulfill his warrior dharma** (Gita 2:31, 33)
- Running from battle would bring **dishonor** (Gita 2:3)
- The soul is **eternal** - killing the body doesn't kill the true self (Gita 2:19)
- Death is like **changing clothes** for the eternal atman
- "The wise grieve neither for the living nor the dead"

> "The eternal in man cannot kill; the eternal in man cannot die. Unborn, eternal, everlasting, this ancient one is not killed when the body is killed." (Gita 2:19-20)

**Arjuna's Response:** Still unconvinced. Needs deeper teaching.

<aside class="notes">
Students often find "killing is illusory" argument unsatisfying - acknowledge this. It's part of larger teaching about detachment, not endorsement of violence. Sets up karma yoga solution.
</aside>

---

## SLIDE 7
# Krishna's Divine Revelation

## [SECTION] The Universal Form (Vishvarupa)

**Chapter 11:** Krishna reveals his cosmic form to Arjuna

### The Vision:
- Krishna shows **universal form** (vishvarupa)—all gods, worlds, beings contained in him
- Arjuna sees past, present, future simultaneously
- "Thousands of arms, faces, eyes, ornaments, raised weapons"
- Terrifying and beautiful: Warriors on both sides already consumed by time
- Blazing light, unbearable radiance

### Arjuna's Response:
- Terror and awe: "The worlds tremble, and so do I!"
- Falls prostrate, begs Krishna to return to gentle form
- Realizes Krishna = **Supreme Lord** (Bhagavad), not mere charioteer

### Theological Significance:
- Establishes Krishna as **Ishvara** (personal God, supreme deity)
- All other gods = aspects/manifestations of Krishna
- Makes Gita foundational for **Vaishnavism** (Krishna devotion)
- Transforms text from philosophy to **devotional scripture**

> "I am Time, the great destroyer of the worlds, engaged here in destroying all people." — Krishna (Gita 11:32)
> [Quote famously cited by J. Robert Oppenheimer at Trinity nuclear test, 1945]

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: "Krishna Vishvarupa universal form Chapter 11 Bhagavad Gita cosmic vision"]

<aside class="notes">
This chapter is theological centerpiece. Without it, Gita = philosophy. With it, Gita = scripture. Compare to Moses/burning bush, Isaiah's temple vision, Transfiguration. Oppenheimer quote shows cultural reach beyond Hinduism.
</aside>

---

## SLIDE 8
## The Battlefield as Metaphor

The entire battlefield becomes a **metaphor** for:
- The struggle between good and evil
- The internal battle within each person
- The conflict between higher and lower nature
- The choice between dharma and personal preference

**Key Message:** Good people must sometimes **enter the fight**; evil triumphs when good people refuse to act.

**Two Levels of Reading:**
1. **Literal**: Righteous war against tyranny (just war theory)
2. **Metaphorical**: Internal spiritual struggle (Gandhi's reading)

[WARNING_BOX: While the Gita uses war as setting, this doesn't mean Hinduism glorifies violence - context and interpretation matter!]

<aside class="notes">
Debate between literal and metaphorical readings continues. Both have textual support. Gandhi read as spiritual allegory; traditional reading accepts righteous warfare. Students should know both.
</aside>

---

## SLIDE 9
# Krishna on the Self and the Gunas

Krishna teaches multiple levels of selfhood:

**Ultimate Self (Atman):**
- Identical with ultimate reality (Brahman)
- **Unchanging**, beyond birth and death
- Pure consciousness, witness

**Lower Self (Guna-based):**
Made up of three **gunas** (strands of "energy-matter"):
- **Sattva** – goodness, purity, harmony, light, knowledge
- **Rajas** – passion, activity, desire, restlessness, attachment
- **Tamas** – darkness, inertia, ignorance, destructiveness, delusion

All three gunas present in everyone; moral character reflects their **relative balance**.

**Vedantic Background:**
Krishna's teaching draws on **Upanishadic philosophy**:
- Atman = Brahman (Day 2 concept)
- But also: Personal God (Krishna) distinct from world
- **Synthesis**: Gita holds both monism (all is one) AND theism (God is personal)

This flexibility explains why both Advaita Vedantins AND theistic bhaktas claim Gita as authoritative!

<aside class="notes">
Gunas are metaphysical, not just psychological. From Samkhya philosophy. Compare to humors (medieval medicine) or personality types—but deeper. Gita synthesizes Upanishadic monism with devotional theism.
</aside>

---

## SLIDE 10
# Nonattached Action – Karma Yoga

## [SECTION] Krishna's Solution

**The Problem:** Attachment to the **guna-self** creates bondage

**The Solution:** Act without attachment to results

Key principles:
- Perform your **dharma** without fixation on success or failure
- Release attachment to the **fruits of action**
- Offer the results to God
- Right to action, not to results
- "Do your duty, but do not be attached to the outcome"

> "You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction." (Gita 2:47)

**The Paradox:** Act fully engaged BUT internally free

<aside class="notes">
Karma yoga = revolution. Previously: Moksha requires renunciation. Gita: Moksha possible while acting in world. Householders can achieve liberation through duty performed selflessly. This democratizes moksha.
</aside>

---

## SLIDE 11
## How to Practice Nonattachment?

Because people have different guna-makeup, Krishna teaches multiple paths:
- **Jnana** (knowledge) - for the philosophical → Realize Atman = Brahman
- **Karma** (action) - for the active → Selfless duty
- **Bhakti** (devotion) - for the emotional → Loving surrender to God

**Krishna presents bhakti as the easiest:**
- Dedicate action and its fruits to **Krishna**
- Krishna functions as finite form of the infinite
- Personal relationship makes nonattachment practical
- Worship of Krishna becomes a path to **moksha**
- "Abandon all duties and surrender to me alone"

**Synthesis of All Three:**
- **Know** the truth (jnana): Atman = Brahman
- **Act** without attachment (karma): Fulfill dharma selflessly
- **Devote** everything to God (bhakti): Offer all to Krishna

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** The Gita synthesizes all three yogas (from Day 2) but emphasizes bhakti as most accessible for most people.

<aside class="notes">
Gita's genius: Doesn't reject earlier paths but integrates them. You can be householder (karma), devotee (bhakti), and seeker (jnana) simultaneously. Appeals to all temperaments.
</aside>

---

## SLIDE 12
# [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## Applying Nonattached Action

**Case Studies:** How would "nonattached action" apply to:
1. A doctor performing surgery
2. A student taking exams
3. An activist fighting injustice
4. A parent raising children

**Comparative Questions:**
- How does karma yoga compare to Christian "faith without works is dead" (James 2:26)?
- How does it differ from Buddhist "right action" (Eightfold Path)?
- How does it relate to Stoic "focus on what you can control"?
- Similarities to Daoist "wu wei" (effortless action)?

**Think-Pair-Share (7 min):** Is nonattachment realistic? Desirable? What are its benefits and limitations?

<aside class="notes">
Students struggle with "act without caring about results." Clarify: Not apathy, but non-clinging. Do your best, release outcome. Compare to athlete in "flow state" or musician lost in music—full engagement without ego attachment.
</aside>

---

## SLIDE 13
# Analysis of the Bhagavad Gita

**The Gita's Genius:** Reconciling duty and liberation

- Insists on absolute importance of **dharma** in sustaining order
- It's not **action** itself that binds, but **attachment** to results
- Therefore:
  - Moksha does **not** require renouncing action
  - It requires **renouncing attachment** while continuing to act
- Bhakti provides a practical path:
  - Direct devotion to God (Krishna)
  - Act vigorously while remaining inwardly free

### The Gita and Social Order

**Complication:** While the Gita offers liberating spiritual paths, it also **reinforces caste hierarchy**:
- "The fourfold order was created by Me according to divisions of quality and work" (4:13)
- Detailed caste duties prescribed (18:41-44)
- "Better to do one's own dharma poorly than another's well" (3:35)
- Svadharma (one's own duty) determined by birth

**Modern Interpretations:**
- **Conservative**: Caste is divinely ordained, part of cosmic order
- **Progressive**: "Guna-based" varna = merit/temperament, not birth (reinterpretation)
- **Radical**: Ambedkar rejected Gita as legitimizing oppression, converted to Buddhism

[DISCUSSION_PROMPT: Can we accept the Gita's ethics while rejecting its social vision? Or are they inseparable?]

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** The Gita's greatness and its problems coexist. Honest engagement means appreciating karma yoga while critiquing caste endorsement—not dismissal, but critical appropriation.

<aside class="notes">
Don't sanitize the Gita. It explicitly endorses varna system. Progressive Hindus reinterpret (guna = merit, not birth). Conservatives cite Gita to defend caste. Students should grapple with this tension. Great texts can be both liberating and oppressive.
</aside>

---

## SLIDE 14
# Gandhi's Reinterpretation

## The Gita as Nonviolent Manifesto

**Gandhi's Reading (early 20th century):**
- Battlefield = **metaphor** for spiritual struggle, not literal war
- "War" = inner battle between good and evil, higher and lower self
- Karma yoga = **selfless service** (seva) and **nonviolent resistance** (satyagraha)
- Nonattachment = freedom from ego and fear, not from compassion
- "The Gita is not a historical work but a great allegory"

### Influence:
- **Indian independence movement** (1920s-1947): Drew on Gita's karma yoga
- **Martin Luther King Jr.**: Learned nonviolence partly through Gandhi/Gita
- **Global peace movements**: Gita as antiwar text (controversial reading!)
- Made Gita accessible to Western audiences as ethics manual

### The Debate:
- **Literalists**: Gita condones righteous war (dharma yuddha = just war)
- **Metaphoricalists** (Gandhi): Gita teaches internal spiritual discipline
- **Text itself**: Ambiguous—supports both readings

**Historical Irony:** Hindu nationalists cite Gita to justify violence; Gandhi cited it for nonviolence. Same text, opposite conclusions.

[DISCUSSION_PROMPT: Can scripture mean the opposite of its literal sense? Who decides correct interpretation?]

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Gandhi's creative reinterpretation shows how religious texts remain alive through new readings—but raises questions about interpretive limits and authority.

<aside class="notes">
Gandhi's reading is brilliant BUT contested. Traditional reading: Krishna tells Arjuna to fight literal war. Gandhi: Entire Mahabharata war is allegory. Both have textual support. Shows hermeneutical (interpretive) flexibility and problems.
</aside>

## SLIDE 15
# Contemporary Hinduism: Tradition and Change

## [SECTION] Modern Movements and Reforms

## Modern Movements and Reforms
- **Hindu Renaissance** (19th-20th century): Ram Mohan Roy, Vivekananda, Aurobindo
- **Colonial encounter**: British rule (1757-1947) spurs reform, redefinition
- **Key figures**: Vivekananda (Vedanta Society), Ramakrishna, Aurobindo
- **Reinterpretation of caste and gender roles** (progressive vs. conservative)
- **Global spread through diaspora** (30+ million Hindus outside India)
- **Yoga and meditation in the West** ($84 billion global industry)
- **Hindu nationalism and politics in India** (see next slide)

[GRID_COMPARISON:
Traditional Elements | Modern Adaptations
- Caste system | Legal protections for Dalits (affirmative action)
- Arranged marriage | Love marriages increasing (especially urban)
- Joint families | Nuclear families in cities
- Temple worship | Online pujas and virtual darshan apps
- Guru tradition | YouTube spiritual teachers, global movements]

<aside class="notes">
Hinduism undergoing rapid transformation. Urban/rural divide, diaspora reinterpretations, technology integration. But also: Hindu nationalism, caste violence ongoing. Tradition and modernity in tension.
</aside>

---

## SLIDE 16
# Hindu Nationalism (Hindutva)

## Political Mobilization and Identity

**Hindutva** = "Hindu-ness" ideology (distinct from Hinduism as religion)
- India as inherently **Hindu nation** (Hindu Rashtra)
- Muslims and Christians as "foreign" threats to Indian identity
- Emerged late 19th century; politically dominant 21st century

### Key Organizations:
- **RSS** (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, 1925): Paramilitary volunteer organization
- **BJP** (Bharatiya Janata Party): Ruling party (2014-present), led by Narendra Modi
- **VHP** (Vishva Hindu Parishad), **Bajrang Dal**: Hindu nationalist groups

### Controversial Actions:
- **Babri Masjid demolition** (1992): 16th-century mosque destroyed by Hindu mob
- **Gujarat riots** (2002): Anti-Muslim violence, 1,000+ killed
- **Cow protection vigilantism**: Lynchings of Muslims/Dalits accused of eating beef
- **Citizenship Amendment Act** (2019): Discriminates against Muslim immigrants
- **Article 370 revocation** (2019): Kashmir's special status ended

[WARNING_BOX: Hindutva ≠ Hinduism. Many Hindus (including scholars, activists, religious leaders) reject Hindu nationalism as distortion of their tradition's pluralism.]

**International Concerns:** Democratic backsliding, religious nationalism, minority rights violations

<aside class="notes">
Politically sensitive but essential. Hindutva dominates Indian politics currently. BJP won landslides 2014, 2019, 2024. Critics: Democratic erosion, minority persecution. Supporters: Cultural revival, strong leadership. Students should understand political Hinduism ≠ religious Hinduism.
</aside>

---

## SLIDE 17
# Dalit Resistance: Ambedkar's Legacy

## Challenging Caste from Within and Without

**Dr. B.R. Ambedkar** (1891-1956):
- Born Dalit ("untouchable" caste), faced severe discrimination
- Educated abroad (PhD Columbia University, law degree London School of Economics)
- Chief architect of **Indian Constitution** (guarantees equality, bans untouchability)
- Concluded after decades: **Caste is intrinsic to Hinduism**, not reformable

### The 1956 Mass Conversion:
- **October 14, 1956**: Ambedkar + 500,000 Dalits **convert to Buddhism**
- Public ceremony in Nagpur, largest religious conversion in modern history
- Rejects Hinduism as inherently oppressive system
- Buddhism offers equality, dignity, liberation from caste hierarchy
- "I was born a Hindu, but I will not die a Hindu"

### Contemporary Dalit Movements:
- **Dalit Panthers** (1970s): Radical activism, inspired by Black Panthers
- **BSP** (Bahujan Samaj Party): Dalit political party, electoral success in Uttar Pradesh
- **Dalit literature and art**: Challenging Brahminical narratives (e.g., Sharankumar Limbale)
- **Ongoing violence**: Caste-based rapes, murders, discrimination continue
- **Manual scavenging**: Dalits still forced to clean human waste (illegal but persists)

**Key Question:** Can Hinduism reform caste, or is caste essential to Hinduism?
- Progressives: Caste is historical accretion, not core teaching
- Ambedkar: Caste woven into Hindu scriptures (including Gita), unfixable

[POPUP: Dalit - "Oppressed" or "broken"; preferred term over "untouchable" (Gandhi's "Harijan"). Approx. 200+ million Dalits in India today (16% of population).]

<aside class="notes">
Ambedkar's mass conversion shocked Hindu establishment. Shows limits of reform—some conclude caste is intrinsic, exit necessary. Dalit movements continue: Political mobilization, cultural production, demanding dignity. Caste violence ongoing despite constitutional protections.
</aside>

---

## SLIDE 18
## Hinduism and Social Justice

**Contemporary Debates:**

### Caste and Reservation:
- **Affirmative action** (reservation) for Scheduled Castes/Tribes in education, jobs
- Debate: Necessary remedy vs. "reverse discrimination"
- **Caste-based violence**: Ongoing atrocities (rapes, murders, discrimination)
- **Inter-caste marriage**: Still taboo for many, sometimes met with "honor killings"

### Gender and Temple Access:
- **Sabarimala case** (2018): Supreme Court allows women (menstruating age) into Kerala temple
- **Massive protests**: Traditional Hindus block women's entry, claim violation of deity's celibacy vow
- **Women priests**: Some temples now ordain women (controversial)
- **Menstrual taboos**: Gradually declining but still powerful in some communities

### LGBTQ+ Rights and Hijra Tradition:
- **Section 377 decriminalized** (2018): India legalizes homosexuality
- **Hijra** (third gender): Traditional recognition of gender-variant people
- Modern LGBTQ+ activists reclaim hijra identity while critiquing marginalization
- Hindu groups divided: Some cite tradition of gender diversity, others condemn as Western influence

### Environmental Movements:
- **Sacred rivers**: Ganga cleanup campaigns using Hindu reverence for rivers
- **Tree worship**: Environmental activism drawing on Hindu nature veneration
- Tensions: Development vs. traditional values, tourism vs. pilgrimage

[DISCUSSION_PROMPT: How do religious traditions balance preserving core teachings with adapting to modern values? Who has authority to decide what's "core" vs. "cultural accretion"?]

<aside class="notes">
Hinduism in flux on social issues. Progressives reinterpret tradition; conservatives resist. Courts intervening (Sabarimala, Section 377). Generational divides: Young urban Hindus often more progressive. Diaspora communities sometimes more conservative than India-based.
</aside>

## SLIDE 19
# Workshop: Creating Your Own Synthesis

## [SECTION] Integration Activity

**Individual Reflection (10 min):**
Using concepts from Hinduism, write about:
1. What is your understanding of ultimate reality?
2. What is the deepest aspect of yourself?
3. What "path" most appeals to you: knowledge, action, devotion, or meditation?
4. How might "nonattached action" apply to your life?
5. What Hindu concept do you find most challenging or problematic?

**Small Group Sharing (15 min):**
- Share one insight from your reflection
- Identify common themes across responses
- Discuss: What Hindu concepts seem most relevant today?
- Debate: Can you accept some Hindu ideas while rejecting others?

<aside class="notes">
Personal reflection helps internalize concepts. Encourage honesty—it's okay to reject ideas. Goal: Engaged understanding, not conversion. Students should articulate what resonates and what doesn't, with reasons.
</aside>

## SLIDE 20
# Closing Connections

## Three Takeaway Lines:

**Historical:** From Indus Valley fertility cults to Vedic sacrifice to Upanishadic philosophy to bhakti devotion to modern reformulations—a story of continuity and change across 4,500 years.

**Social:** From caste and dharma to modern debates over social justice and reform in India—tensions between tradition and equality, hierarchy and human rights.

**Personal:** From Gita's nonattached action to modern questions about vocation, activism, and inner freedom—how to act in the world without being enslaved by outcomes.

**The Paradox of Hinduism:**
- Liberating philosophy (Atman = Brahman) + oppressive social system (caste)
- Radical inclusivity (many paths to moksha) + hierarchical exclusion (untouchability)
- This isn't inconsistency—it's the complexity of 4,000-year-old living tradition

<aside class="notes">
Draw these three lines on board as visual summary of three-day journey. Emphasize both/and thinking: Hinduism contains multitudes. Great wisdom AND serious injustice. Students should hold both.
</aside>

---

## SLIDE 21
# [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## Chapter Synthesis and Assessment

**Final Reflection Paper Prompt (choose ONE):**
1. Compare the Hindu concept of moksha with "salvation" or "liberation" in another tradition. What are the different diagnoses of the human problem? The different solutions?
2. Analyze how the Bhagavad Gita addresses the problem of ethical dilemmas. Is karma yoga a satisfying solution? Why or why not?
3. Evaluate whether the caste system is essential to Hinduism or a historical addition that can be reformed or removed. Use specific textual/historical evidence.
4. **NEW**: Assess Ambedkar's claim that Buddhism offers what Hinduism cannot: genuine equality and dignity for all. Is this fair to Hinduism?

**Peer Review (in class or homework):**
Exchange papers with a partner for feedback on:
- Clear thesis statement
- Use of specific Hindu concepts (Brahman, Atman, dharma, karma, moksha, etc.)
- Fair representation of the tradition (both strengths and problems)
- Personal insight or application (critical thinking, not just summary)
- Evidence-based argumentation

<aside class="notes">
Reflection paper assesses deep understanding, critical thinking, comparative analysis. Peer review teaches evaluative reading. Encourage students to take positions, argue, engage—not just report.
</aside>

## SLIDE 22
# Looking Ahead

## Next Chapter Preview: Buddhism

### Buddhism's Emergence from Hindu Context:
- How Buddhism emerges as reform movement (~563-483 BCE)
- Buddha's **critique** of caste (rejects birth-based hierarchy)
- Buddha's **critique** of ritual (rejects Brahmin sacrifice monopoly)
- Buddha's **critique** of Vedic authority (rejects shruti status)

### Different Understanding of Self:
- **Anatman/Anatta** (no-self) vs. Hindu Atman (eternal self)
- This is THE major philosophical difference
- Implications for liberation, ethics, meditation

### Nirvana vs. Moksha:
- Both = liberation from samsara
- But different metaphysics: What's liberated if there's no self?

## Key Questions to Ponder:
- What happens when a reform movement becomes a separate religion?
- How do "child" religions relate to "parent" traditions?
- Can you accept karma and rebirth without accepting Hinduism?
- If there's no self, who is reborn? Who achieves nirvana?

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** We've covered Hinduism's diversity, core concepts, and contemporary relevance. Next: Buddhism's revolutionary response to these same questions—using Hindu vocabulary but reaching opposite conclusions!

**Homework:** Complete reflection paper and read Buddhism chapter introduction.

<aside class="notes">
Bridge to Buddhism essential. Buddha was Hindu reformer who created new religion. Shares vocabulary (karma, samsara, dharma, nirvana/moksha) but radically redefines. Anatman vs. Atman = irreconcilable difference. Sets up great philosophical debate.
</aside>
