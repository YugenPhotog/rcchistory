[SECTION: Second Temple Period and Transformation]

## SLIDE 1: The Second Temple Period (539 BCE–70 CE)

### From Exile to Return

**Babylonian Captivity**
- Prophet **Jeremiah** denounces sins of Judah and predicts destruction
- 586 BCE: **Babylon** besieges Jerusalem
  - First Temple destroyed
  - Many (but not all) Jews deported to Babylon

**Persian Restoration**
- 539 BCE: **Persians** conquer Babylon
- **Cyrus the Great** allows exiles to return and rebuild the Temple
- **Judah** becomes a province in the Persian Empire
- 515 BCE: **Second Temple** completed and rededicated

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Note continuity: despite exile, covenant peoplehood continues; identity shifts from land-centered to Torah-centered.

---

## SLIDE 2: Hellenistic and Hasmonean Periods

### Greek Influence and Jewish Independence

- 332 BCE: **Alexander the Great** conquers Judah → Greek control
- Hellenistic rulers introduce Greek culture and, at times, religious pressures
- **Maccabean Revolt** throws off Greek domination
- **Hasmonean dynasty** rules an independent Judea for about a century
- **Hanukkah** commemorates the rededication of the Temple after Maccabean victory

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Map showing Hellenistic kingdoms and Judea]

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Useful moment to talk about Hellenization and Jewish responses (accommodation vs resistance).

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Hanukkah = "dedication" - it's about religious freedom and maintaining Jewish identity under pressure.

---

## SLIDE 3: Roman Period and Crisis

### The End of the Second Temple

- 63 BCE: Rome intervenes and annexes Judea into the **Roman Empire**
- **Herodian Dynasty**:
  - **Herod the Great** (37–4 BCE) rules as Roman client king
  - Known for massive building projects, including expansion of the Second Temple
- Tensions grow between Jewish population and Roman authorities
- **First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE)** erupts

### Destruction of the Temple (70 CE)

- Romans destroy the **Second Temple**
- 132–136 CE: Bar Kokhba revolt; Romans respond by:
  - Renaming the province **Judea → Syria Palestina**
  - Turning Jerusalem into a Roman colony, **Aelia Capitolina**
  - Displacing large portions of the Jewish population

[WARNING_BOX: Not all Jews leave the land. Jewish communities remain in Palestine continuously from antiquity to the present.]

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Emphasize Temple destruction as a massive theological crisis: no Temple, no sacrifices—Judaism must evolve.

---

## SLIDE 4: [ASSESSMENT_BREAK] Understanding the Crisis

### Critical Thinking Questions:

1. **Why was the destruction of the Second Temple such a theological crisis?**
   [POPUP: Temple was center of worship, sacrifice, and priestly authority - without it, how do you maintain covenant relationship with God?]

2. **What options did Judaism have after 70 CE?**
   [POPUP: Could have disappeared, become purely ethnic group, or transform religious practice - they chose transformation]

[DISCUSSION_PROMPT: "If your religion's central sacred space was destroyed, how might your faith community adapt?"]

---

[SECTION: Diaspora and Rabbinic Judaism]

## SLIDE 5: The Jewish Diaspora

### Jewish–Roman Wars and Scattering

- 63 BCE: Jerusalem captured by Romans
- 66 CE: First Jewish revolt
- 70 CE: Siege of Jerusalem and destruction of Second Temple
- 132–136 CE: Second major revolt; heavy losses of life and population

**Result: Diaspora** – Jews scattered to many regions:
- Egypt, North Africa
- Iberian Peninsula
- Central Asia, etc.

**Diaspora**: Movement, migration, or scattering of a people away from ancestral homeland.

---

## SLIDE 6: Revolutionary Transformation

### From Temple to Synagogue

**Significance of the Diaspora:**

[GRID_COMPARISON:
| Temple Judaism | Rabbinic Judaism |
|----------------|------------------|
| Temple worship | Synagogue prayer |
| Priests (Levites) | Rabbis (teachers) |
| Sacrifices | Study and good deeds |
| Centralized in Jerusalem | Decentralized worldwide |
| Oral tradition | Written Talmud |]

- Rabbis (successors of Pharisees) preserve a **lay-led** Judaism
- Rabbis become spiritual leaders in local synagogues
- Judaism becomes **portable** - can be practiced anywhere

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Help students see synagogue-rabbi-Torah as the "portable" replacements for Temple-priest-sacrifice.

---

## SLIDE 7: Origins of Antisemitism

### The Dark Side of Diaspora

- In Diaspora, Jews often viewed as **outsiders**
- In agrarian societies, Jews frequently barred from landownership
- Many turn to non-farming occupations (trade, finance, crafts)
- Become convenient **scapegoats** in times of crisis

**Code of Justinian (527 CE):**
- Contains discriminatory laws against Jews
- Influences European legal systems for centuries
- Contributes to institutionalized antisemitism

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Clarify: antisemitism has religious, economic, and social roots; it changes over time. You can link forward to medieval and modern antisemitism in later courses.

[SECTION: Essential Jewish Teachings]

## SLIDE 8: Core Jewish Beliefs

### Essential Jewish Teachings

Key doctrines include:
- **Monotheism** - One God
- **Covenant People** - Special relationship with God
- **Hebrew Bible (Tanakh)** - Sacred scripture
- **Ethical Monotheism** - God as source of morality

**SPEAKER NOTES:** This is a good transition from history into theology: what do Jews believe about God and their obligations?

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Visual diagram showing interconnection of these concepts]

---

## SLIDE 9: Ethical Monotheism Defined

### Revolutionary Concept

**Definitions:**
- **Monotheism**: belief in one and only one God
- **Ethical monotheism**: belief in one God who is the **source of morality** and who **demands goodness** (ethical conduct)

> "Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one!" (Deut 6:4)

### Key Implications:
- God gives **moral obligations** to His people
- God is a **law-giver** who is not capricious or arbitrary
- **One God means one human race**:
  - No person or group is intrinsically more valuable
  - One moral standard for all people (universal morality)

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Ask students how this contrasts with ancient polytheism where different gods could endorse different moralities.

---

## SLIDE 10: Nature of God in Judaism

### Four Key Attributes

**1. God is Transcendent**
- "God created the heavens and the earth" (Gen 1:1)
- God is **above and separate from nature**, not part of it
- Nature is finite; God is infinite
- God is **eternal and unchanging** (cf. Ps 102:25–27)

**2. God is Personal**
- God **cares** about His creations
- Humans can **know** and **relate** to God

**3. God is Good**
- God rules by moral standards, not arbitrary power

**4. God is Holy**
- **Holy** = spiritually pure, consecrated, set apart
- "Be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy" (Lev 19:2)

**SPEAKER NOTES:** You can contrast this with gods in other mythologies who act immorally; here God *is* the moral standard.

---

## SLIDE 11: [ASSESSMENT_BREAK] Ethical Monotheism

### Comprehension Check:

**Match the concept with its implication:**

1. One God → [   ]
2. God is source of morality → [   ]
3. God is transcendent → [   ]
4. God is holy → [   ]

**Options:**
A. Humans called to be holy too
B. Universal human dignity
C. Above nature, not part of it
D. Objective right and wrong

[POPUP: Answers: 1-B, 2-D, 3-C, 4-A]

---

## SLIDE 12: "Be Holy, For I Am Holy"

### Holiness and Imitatio Dei

**Imitatio Dei** = imitation of God

**Rabbinic reflections:**
- **Rashi** – links holiness to abstaining from sexual immorality and idolatry
- **Nahmanides (Ramban)** – holiness goes beyond avoiding forbidden acts; requires positive ethical behavior beyond legal minimum
- **Midrash** – "You shall be holy" is comprehensive commandment from which many others flow

**Holiness in Everyday Life:**
- Radical idea: **every Jew**, not just priests, can be holy in daily actions
- Ethical behavior is intrinsic to the path of holiness
- Ritual, ethics, and spirituality are tightly intertwined

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Ask students to identify modern examples of "holiness in everyday life" (honesty in business, how you treat workers, etc.).

---

[SECTION: Sacred Texts]

## SLIDE 13: The Jewish Canon - Tanakh

### Structure of Hebrew Bible

**Tanakh** - Name for the **Hebrew Bible**

Acronym from three sections:
1. **Torah** ("instruction" or "law") - 5 books
2. **Nevi'im** ("prophets") - Historical and prophetic books
3. **Ketuvim** ("writings") - Wisdom literature, psalms, etc.

- Canon finalized by the first century CE
- Viewed by traditional Jews as the **written revelation of God**

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Visual showing three sections of Tanakh with book names]

---

## SLIDE 14: Beyond the Bible

### Talmud and Midrash

**Midrash** – biblical exegesis and commentary
- Explores meanings beyond literal text
- Fills in gaps in biblical narratives

**Talmud** – discussions and legal opinions of thousands of rabbis
- **Mishnah**: Oral law written down (c. 200 CE)
- **Gemara**: Commentary on Mishnah
- Two versions: Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmud
- Forms basis for later **Jewish law codes**

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Clarify that for rabbinic Judaism, Torah is central, but Talmud and later law are how Torah is actually lived.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Think of it this way: Torah = constitution, Talmud = supreme court decisions interpreting it

---

## SLIDE 15: The Divine Name

### Teachings of Judaism – One God

**Shema Yisrael**
- Deut 6:4 – "Hear, O Israel: YHWH is our God, YHWH is one."
- Central declaration of Jewish faith
- Recited daily and in liturgy

**The Divine Name (Tetragrammaton)**
- **YHWH** – "tetragrammaton" (four-letter name)
- Related to Hebrew verb **hayah** ("to be")
- Indicates God's **self-existence** and uncreated nature
- Observant Jews do not pronounce this name aloud
- Instead substitute: **Adonai** ("my Lord") or **HaShem** ("the Name")

**"I AM" – Exodus 3:13–14**
- God's self-identification to Moses: "I AM THAT I AM"

---

## SLIDE 16: Titles of Deity

### Many Names, One God

Common titles in Jewish practice:
- **El** – generic word for God
- **El Shaddai** – "God of the Mountain" or "God Almighty"
- **El Elyon** – "Most High God"
- **Adonai** – "My Lord"
- **HaShem** – "The Name"
- **HaKadosh Baruch Hu** – "The Holy One, blessed be He"

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Have students consider what each title emphasizes about God's character.

[DISCUSSION_PROMPT: "Why might having multiple titles for one God be important for worship and understanding?"]

---

## SLIDE 17: [ASSESSMENT_BREAK] Text and Theology Review

### Synthesis Questions:

1. **How did Judaism survive the destruction of the Temple?**
   - Transform from sacrifice-based to study/prayer-based
   - Develop portable practices (synagogue, Torah study)
   - Create rabbinic leadership structure

2. **What makes Jewish monotheism "ethical"?**
   - God is source of morality
   - One God = one human family = universal ethics
   - Holiness requires ethical behavior, not just ritual

3. **Why is the Talmud necessary if Jews have the Torah?**
   - Torah needs interpretation for daily life
   - Oral tradition preserves how to practice
   - Changing circumstances require guidance

---

## SLIDE 18: Day 2 Summary

### Key Transformations:

1. **From Temple to Torah**
   - Destruction forces creative adaptation
   - Rabbinic Judaism emerges
   - Portable practices ensure survival

2. **Ethical Monotheism**
   - One God who demands goodness
   - Universal morality
