# [SECTION] Japanese Fascist Atrocities – World War II  

## The Rape of Nanking (Nanjing Massacre)  

- **Rampage of ~7 weeks** (1937–1938).  
- Brutal **murder and rape** by invading Japanese troops.  
- Estimated **200,000–300,000** Chinese civilians and prisoners of war murdered.  
- Estimated **20,000–80,000** women raped.  
- Creation of an **International Safety Zone** by foreign residents to protect civilians (partial success).

**SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Encourage students to compare Allied postwar responses: Nuremberg and Tokyo Trials. Ask what accountability looked like and where it fell short.

## SLIDE 3

## Systematic Sexual Violence and Medical Atrocities

### Comfort Women System  

- Institution of forced sexual slavery ("**comfort women**") across Japanese-occupied territories.  
- Women and girls from Korea, China, the Philippines, and other regions forced into military brothels.  

### Unit 731  

- Secret Japanese military unit conducting **biological and medical experiments** on prisoners.  
- Experiments included:  
  - Deliberate infection with plague and other diseases.  
  - Vivisection and extreme cruelty.  

[WARNING_BOX: "These systematic atrocities demonstrate how military culture and ideology can normalize extreme violence against civilians."]

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**
> Japanese wartime atrocities show how racial ideology and military culture combined to dehumanize enemies and enable mass violence.

## SLIDE 4

## Killing Fields of Cambodia  

- Under **Pol Pot** and the **Khmer Rouge**, Cambodia experiences radical agrarian Communism.  
- City dwellers forced into the countryside as laborers.  
- Mass executions at designated **killing fields**.  
- Total deaths: about **2 million**, roughly **20%** of the population.  

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Memorial stupa with skulls at Choeung Ek killing fields]

**SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Talk about ideological purity and utopian promises: how do these justify exterminating "class enemies" or "parasites" in the minds of perpetrators?

## SLIDE 5

## Total Communist Atrocities – 20th Century  

- Combined death toll often estimated at **around 100 million**.  

[GRID_COMPARISON:
| Ideology | Major Examples | Estimated Deaths |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Fascism/Nazism | Holocaust, Japanese atrocities | 15-20 million |
| Communism | USSR, China, Cambodia | ~100 million |
| Ethnic Nationalism | Armenian, Rwandan genocides | 3-4 million |
]

**SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Place this alongside Nazi crimes without collapsing the differences. Invite comparison of:  
> - Racial vs class-based targets  
> - Industrial vs agrarian methods  
> - Role of ideology and bureaucracy in both systems.

# [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]

## Atrocity Comparison Exercise

Working in small groups, create a brief comparison of ONE aspect across the genocides we've studied:

1. **Group A**: Compare the role of ideology
2. **Group B**: Compare methods of killing
3. **Group C**: Compare targeted victims
4. **Group D**: Compare international responses

5 minutes to prepare, then 2-minute presentations.

# [SECTION] Homo hominī lupus est – "Man is a Wolf to Man"  

## Man's Inhumanity to Man and Human Nature  

- Latin phrase **"Homo hominī lupus est"**: "Man is a wolf to man."  
- Raises the question: **What is human nature?**  

Key claims:  

- Human nature is fundamentally **the same and universal**.  
- Human beings are born **good and innocent, but "encumbered."**  
- Humans have **moral agency** and can choose good or evil.  

**SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Invite discussion: do students agree that we are born good and become evil or saintly through choices? Compare to other views (original sin, blank slate, sociobiology, etc.).

---

## SLIDE 8

## The Making of Monsters and Saints

Our ability:  
- To **think** (inner dialogue).  
- To **choose**.  
- To act on those choices → shapes our character.  

**Key insight**: **Monsters or saints are made, not born.**  

"The wrench in the works" of human goodness is **human evil** – the choices we make.  

[POPUP: "This view assumes free will and moral responsibility—contrast with deterministic views that see behavior as purely caused by genes, environment, or social structures."]

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**
> Central question: If humans are born good, how do we explain the massive evil we've just studied? The answer involves understanding how choices shape character over time.

# [SECTION] Radical Evil – Immanuel Kant  

## Pathologizing Evil vs Radical Evil  

- Many try to understand evil by **medicalizing** or **psychologizing** it (e.g., mental illness).  
- Kant argues that for some actions, **"evil" is the only adequate explanation**.  
- This kind of evil is **unfathomable** in ordinary moral categories.  
- Kant calls it **"radical evil."**  

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Portrait of Immanuel Kant]

---

## SLIDE 10

### Kant's Account of Radical Evil  

- Failure of moral agents to obey the **moral law** is **symptom** of a deeper **corruption of character**.  
- There is an **innate propensity to evil**:  
  - To subordinate the moral law to **self-conceit** (undue pride in oneself).  
- Because this propensity **corrupts the entire character**, and is the **innate source** of other evil deeds, it can be called **"radical."**  

**SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Clarify that "innate propensity" does not mean people are compelled to do evil; rather, there is a basic tendency that can be either resisted or indulged.

[DISCUSSION_PROMPT: "Does Kant's idea of an 'innate propensity to evil' contradict the earlier claim that humans are born good? How might we reconcile these views?"]

---

## SLIDE 11

## Radical Evil – Summary  

- Some want to understand evil by pathologizing it.  
- That may explain some cases, but in others **sheer evil choice** seems the only explanation.  
- This kind of evil is **extreme and hard to comprehend**.  
- **Consistent evil choices** have a **transformative effect**:  
  - Evil choices **shape** and **create** an evil character or nature.  

[WARNING_BOX: "The danger: Once character is deeply corrupted by consistent evil choices, change becomes increasingly difficult (though not impossible)."]

**SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Ask students whether they think character can become so deformed that change is nearly impossible—without claiming it is literally impossible.

# [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]

## Applying Kant's Theory

**Individual Reflection** (3 minutes):
Choose one perpetrator or group from our studies (Nazi officials, Soviet guards, Khmer Rouge soldiers, etc.) and analyze using Kant's framework:

1. What moral law did they violate?
2. How might "self-conceit" have played a role?
3. How did repeated evil choices shape their character?

**Pair Discussion** (3 minutes):
Share your analysis with a partner and identify common patterns.

# Hannah Arendt's Response to Evil

## From Radical Evil to Extreme Evil

Building on Kant, Hannah Arendt observed something new in 20th-century totalitarianism:

- Evil on an **unprecedented scale**
- Requiring **mass participation**
- By **ordinary people**

This led her to develop two key concepts:
1. **Extreme Evil** (in totalitarian systems)
2. **The Banality of Evil** (how ordinary people participate)

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Portrait of Hannah Arendt]

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**
> Arendt doesn't reject Kant but adds a new dimension: how modern bureaucratic systems enable evil on a massive scale through ordinary people "just doing their jobs."

---

## SLIDE 14

## Preview: The Banality of Evil

Next class, we'll explore Arendt's revolutionary insight:

- The Eichmann trial and the "mindless bureaucrat"
- How totalitarian systems create "superfluous humans"
- The relationship between inability to think and evil
- What this means for education and prevention

**Key question for reflection:**
How do ordinary people become participants in extraordinary evil?

---

## SLIDE 15

## Day 2 Summary

1. **Japanese atrocities** demonstrated how military ideology enables systematic violence
2. **The scale of 20th-century killing** (~120 million) demands philosophical explanation
3. **"Man is wolf to man"** raises fundamental questions about human nature
4. **Kant's "radical evil"** locates evil in the corruption of moral character through choice
5. **Character transformation** through repeated choices explains how ordinary people become perpetrators

---

## SLIDE 16

# Homework and Next Class

**For Day 3:**
1. Read Arendt's "Eichmann in Jerusalem" excerpt (provided)
2. Reflection question: "What does it mean to 'think' in Arendt's sense? Give an example from your own life when you failed to think morally."
3. Come prepared to discuss prevention and education

**Remember:** We're not just studying historical atrocities—we're asking how to prevent future ones.
