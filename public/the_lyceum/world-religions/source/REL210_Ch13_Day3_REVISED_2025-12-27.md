## SLIDE 1: Anti-Mormonism

- Writings and media that seek to **"expose," ridicule, or disprove** Mormon teachings and practices.  
- Stems from:  
  - Cultural, political, and economic tensions in the 19th century.  
  - Disaffected former Mormons.  
  - Non-Mormons offended by LDS doctrines or by the Church's success.  
- Many critical sources mix fact, rumor, and polemic.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Remind students of Stendahl's rules:  
- Let believers define their own faith.  
- Don't compare your best to someone else's worst.  
- Allow for "holy envy."  
Encourage them to seek out LDS self-descriptions as well as neutral scholarship.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Anti-Mormon literature = example of how NRMs face organized opposition. Remember Stendahl's rules when evaluating sources!

## [SECTION] Case Study 2: The Church of Scientology

## SLIDE 2: The Church of Scientology - Origins and Basic Ideas

- Psychologically oriented NRM founded by **L. Ron Hubbard** in the 1950s.  
- Early teachings introduced through books:  
  - *The Original Thesis*  
  - *Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health*  
- Initially focused on understanding and treating **mental and emotional problems**.  
- Later broadened into a religion called **Scientology**.

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: L. Ron Hubbard portrait or early Dianetics book cover]

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Link this to mid‑20th‑century self-help culture and popular psychology. Many students will be familiar with Scientology from media; keep focus on doctrine and structure, not celebrity gossip.

---

## SLIDE 3: Core Ideas

- Goal of human existence: **survival and enjoyment** of the world.  
- Deeds and thought habits that enhance survival are good and produce pleasure.  
- Deeds that go against survival are destructive.  
- When the mind is not functioning well, the **"reactive mind"** takes over, causing irrational behavior and suffering.

[POPUP: Compare "reactive mind" to concepts in psychology like the unconscious or trauma responses]

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Scientology focuses on mental/emotional healing first, spiritual development second. Very different origin from traditional religions.

---

## SLIDE 4: Dianetics, Engrams, and Auditing

- **Engram**:  
  - Image or imprint of a past experience stored in the mind that hinders full functioning.  
- Hubbard's goal:  
  - Help people identify and resolve their engrams.  
- **Auditing**:  
  - One-on-one counseling process.  
  - Auditor guides the person through memories to locate and clear engrams.  
- **E-meter**:  
  - Electronic device used during auditing.  
  - Intended to help identify areas of emotional charge associated with engrams.  

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Compare this, cautiously, to forms of therapy—but emphasize that Scientology treats it as a religious technology, not just talk therapy.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Key terms: Engram (mental blockage), Auditing (counseling process), E-meter (electronic device). All about clearing mental obstacles.

## SLIDE 5: Comparing Origins

**GRID_COMPARISON:**
| Aspect | Mormonism (1830s) | Scientology (1950s) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Founder's Background | Poor farmer, visionary | Science fiction writer |
| Initial Focus | Restoration of Christianity | Mental health/self-help |
| Sacred Text | Book of Mormon (ancient history) | Dianetics (modern psychology) |
| Early Reception | Religious persecution | Medical/scientific criticism |

**Question:** How does historical context shape each movement's development?

---

## SLIDE 6: Thetan, MEST, and Exteriorization

- **Thetan**:  
  - The true self of every person.  
  - A spiritual being distinct from the physical body.  
- Interaction of **thetans** gives rise to **MEST**:  
  - **MEST** = Matter, Energy, Space, Time – the physical universe that traps thetans.  
- **Exteriorization**:  
  - State in which a person senses their consciousness as leaving the body.  
  - Understood as a thetan becoming more aware of its independent existence.

[WARNING_BOX: These concepts become increasingly esoteric at higher levels]

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Point out that Scientology cosmology presents humans as fundamentally immortal spiritual beings who have become trapped and confused.

---

## SLIDE 7: Operating Thetan (OT) Levels and Dynamics

- **Operating Thetan (OT) Levels**:  
  - Stages at which a Scientologist is considered to function as a fully conscious, highly capable thetan.  
  - Progression through graded levels of training and auditing.

- **Dynamics**:  
  - The drive for survival expressed through **eight dynamics** or spheres:  
    1. Self.  
    2. Family and sex.  
    3. Groups such as community and nation.  
    4. All humankind.  
    5. All living things including animals.  
    6. The physical universe (MEST).  
    7. Spiritual beings.  
    8. Infinity or God.  

**SPEAKER NOTES:** This is a helpful diagram moment—students often grasp the eight dynamics more easily visually.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Eight dynamics = expanding circles of survival/concern. Start with self, expand to infinity/God. Very systematic approach.

## [SECTION] Organization and Structure

## SLIDE 8: Organization of the Church of Scientology

### Central Organizations

- **Flag Service Organization**  
  - Society of highly dedicated church members established by Hubbard.  
  - Headquarters in **Clearwater, Florida**.  
  - Provides advanced training for the highest OT levels.

- **Sea Organization (Sea Org)**  
  - Group of full-time church workers.  
  - Assist national and local Scientology organizations.  
  - Known for strict discipline and long-term commitment.

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Scientology Flag Building in Clearwater or Sea Org uniform]

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Highlight how strongly structured and centralized Scientology is compared to many other NRMs.

---

## SLIDE 9: Local Churches and Governance

- Scientology functions through local churches with a **business-like structure**.  
- Administered by the **Church of Scientology International (CSI)**.  
- **Religious Technology Center (RTC)** holds final authority over the use of Scientology's trademarks and "religious technology."  
- In 2012, the church announces a program to transform local churches into **Ideal Organizations ("Ideal Orgs")** with upgraded facilities and standardized design.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Scientology = highly centralized, business-like structure. Very different from lay-led movements like early Mormonism.

---

## [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## SLIDE 10: Analyzing NRM Structure

**DISCUSSION_PROMPT:**
Compare the organizational structures of Mormonism and Scientology. How might each structure serve the movement's goals? Consider:
- Centralization vs. local autonomy
- Lay leadership vs. professional clergy
- Democratic vs. hierarchical decision-making

---

## [SECTION] Controversies and Critical Analysis

## SLIDE 11: Controversies Surrounding Scientology

- **Medical Criticisms**  
  - Physicians and psychiatrists have charged that **Dianetics** amounts to practicing medicine without a license.

- **Government Scrutiny**  
  - Scientology has been subject to investigations and legal battles with various governments.

- **Former Members' Allegations**  
  - Claim deceptive financial practices.  
  - Report harassment of journalists, critics, and those who try to leave the church.  

**SPEAKER NOTES:** This is a good place to revisit Stendahl's rules. Encourage students to distinguish between:  
- Academic description of beliefs and practices.  
- Legal and ethical critiques.  
- Sensationalized media narratives.

---

## SLIDE 12: Applying Academic Framework

When studying controversial NRMs, remember to:

1. **Distinguish between**:
   - Theological claims (what believers say)
   - Sociological patterns (what scholars observe)
   - Legal/ethical issues (what courts/society debate)

2. **Apply Stendahl's Rules**:
   - Ask adherents, not just critics
   - Compare fairly
   - Allow for "holy envy"

3. **Consider historical context**:
   - All religions faced controversy when new
   - Social location affects reception
   - Time often normalizes movements

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Key skill: Separate belief claims from social analysis from ethical evaluation. Be fair but not naive.

---

## SLIDE 13: Patterns in NRM Development

Common patterns across NRMs:

1. **Charismatic founder** with new revelation/insight
2. **Initial small group** of devoted followers  
3. **Distinctive practices** that set group apart
4. **Conflict with mainstream** society/religion
5. **Adaptation over time** (or dissolution)
6. **Routinization** after founder's death

[POPUP: "Routinization" = shift from charismatic to institutional leadership]

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Help students see these as sociological patterns, not value judgments about truth or falsity.

## [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## SLIDE 14: Case Study Application

**Small Group Exercise:**
Choose either Mormonism or Scientology. Using the six patterns from the previous slide, trace how your chosen NRM has developed. Be prepared to share 2-3 specific examples.

**Time:** 5 minutes discussion, 5 minutes sharing

---

## SLIDE 15: Why Study New Religious Movements?

NRMs help us understand:

- **Religious innovation** - How new traditions emerge
- **Social dynamics** - How groups form and maintain boundaries  
- **Cultural change** - How societies respond to religious diversity
- **Human nature** - Why people seek new spiritual paths
- **Academic method** - How to study religion objectively

**Remember:** Studying ≠ endorsing or condemning

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** NRMs = laboratory for understanding all religion. Same processes, just more visible because recent.

---

## SLIDE 16: Closing Reflection on NRMs

**Synthesis Questions:**
- Why do new religious movements arise at particular moments in history?  
- How do social, political, and economic pressures shape their formation and reception?  
- How can we study groups we might personally find strange—or even troubling—with fairness, rigor, and "holy envy" where appropriate?

**Final Thought:** Today's NRM may be tomorrow's established religion. Early Christianity was once a "new religious movement" in the Roman Empire!

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Big takeaway: All religions were once "new." Study with empathy, analyze with rigor, judge with caution.
