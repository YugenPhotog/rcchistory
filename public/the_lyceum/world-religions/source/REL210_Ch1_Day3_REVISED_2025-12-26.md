### SLIDE 42: Day 3 Overview [SECTION]

# Theories and Methods

How do we study religion academically?

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Quick 2-minute recap of Days 1-2.

Today's focus: Now that we know WHAT religion might be, let's explore HOW scholars study it—different theoretical approaches and methods.

We'll end with a hands-on workshop applying everything from Chapter 1.

---

### SLIDE 43: Two Main Approaches

## Functionalist vs. Substantive Approaches

[GRID_COMPARISON]
**LEFT:**
### [POPUP_TRIGGER id="functionalism"]Functionalist Approach[/POPUP_TRIGGER]

**Question:** "What does religion **DO**?"

**Focus:** Social, psychological, or economic functions and effects

**Emphasis:** How religion shapes society, provides comfort, creates identity

**Thinkers:** Marx, Freud, Durkheim

**RIGHT:**
### [POPUP_TRIGGER id="substantive"]Substantive Approach[/POPUP_TRIGGER]

**Question:** "What does religion **MEAN**?"

**Focus:** Ideas, experiences, and intentions that motivate people

**Emphasis:** Conscious human agency, emotion, meaning-making

**Thinkers:** Otto, Eliade, Tylor, Frazer
[/GRID_COMPARISON]

[POPUP id="functionalism"]
**Functionalism**

A theoretical approach that explains religion by examining what it DOES rather than what it IS. Asks: What functions does religion serve?

- Social cohesion (Durkheim)
- Psychological comfort (Freud)
- Economic control (Marx)
- Legitimating authority
- Creating meaning systems

Can be reductive if it ignores what practitioners consciously believe/intend.
[/POPUP]

[POPUP id="substantive"]
**Substantive Approach**

A theoretical approach that explains religion by examining the IDEAS and EXPERIENCES that motivate people. Asks: What do practitioners believe/experience/intend?

Focus on:
- Religious ideas and doctrines
- Phenomenology of experience
- Meaning-making
- Conscious motivations

Can miss unconscious social functions if it only looks at explicit meanings.
[/POPUP]

**Neither is more "correct"**—they ask different questions and reveal different aspects of religious life.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Spend 2-3 minutes.

Frame as complementary, not competing.

Next slides will unpack each with concrete examples.

---

### SLIDE 44: Functionalism in Action

## What Does Religion DO?

**Functionalists ask:**

◆ How does religion create social cohesion?

◆ How does religion provide psychological comfort?

◆ How does religion legitimate authority structures?

◆ How does religion mask or reinforce economic exploitation?

**Key Functionalist Thinkers:**

◆ **Karl Marx** (Economics): Religion numbs people to exploitation

◆ **Sigmund Freud** (Psychology): Religion meets need for father figure

◆ **Émile Durkheim** (Sociology): Religion reinforces group identity

◆ **Max Weber** (Sociology): Religion influences economic systems

**Important Note:**

Functionalism doesn't necessarily dismiss or attack religion—it analyzes what religion *does* rather than whether beliefs are true.

Early functionalists (Marx, Freud) were often hostile critics. Later scholars became more neutral, using functional analysis as one analytical tool among many.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Spend 2-3 minutes.

Emphasize the QUESTION: "What does this DO?"

Note the revision: "became more neutral" instead of "less hostile" (more scholarly tone).

Make clear: You can use functionalist analysis without being anti-religious. Many religious scholars use it!

---

### SLIDE 45: Substantive Approach in Action

## What Does Religion MEAN?

**Substantive theorists emphasize:**

◆ Conscious human intention, emotion, and agency

◆ What practitioners *think* they're doing and why

◆ The content of religious ideas and experiences

◆ Irreducibility of religious meanings (can't be "explained away")

**Key Substantive Thinkers:**

◆ **Edward Tylor & James Frazer** (19th century): Religion as explanation of natural phenomena

◆ **Rudolf Otto** (Phenomenology): Religion emerges from numinous experience

◆ **Mircea Eliade** (Phenomenology): Religion cannot be reduced to social/psychological factors

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Spend 2 minutes.

Emphasize the QUESTION: "What does this MEAN to practitioners?"

Preview: "We'll discuss problematic aspects of Tylor/Frazer shortly, and then dive deeper into phenomenology."

---

### SLIDE 46: Comparing Approaches—Example [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]

## Same Practice, Different Questions

**Example: A person fasts during [POPUP_TRIGGER id="ramadan"]Ramadan[/POPUP_TRIGGER].**

[POPUP id="ramadan"]
**Ramadan (رَمَضَان)**

The ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslims fast from dawn to sunset (no food, drink, smoking, sexual relations). One of the Five Pillars of Islam.

Commemorates the first revelation of the Qur'an to Muhammad. Emphasizes self-discipline, empathy for the poor, spiritual reflection, and community solidarity.
[/POPUP]

[GRID_COMPARISON]
**LEFT:**
### Functionalist Questions:

◆ Does this create group solidarity among Muslims?

◆ Does fasting build self-discipline that serves social order?

◆ How does this practice reinforce religious authority?

◆ What psychological needs does the practice meet?

◆ Does communal fasting create social bonds?

**RIGHT:**
### Substantive Questions:

◆ What does the person believe about Allah's command?

◆ How does the person experience their relationship to God through fasting?

◆ What theological meanings does fasting carry in Islamic thought?

◆ What is the practitioner's conscious motivation?

◆ What spiritual transformation do they seek?
[/GRID_COMPARISON]

**Both are valid questions about different aspects of the same practice.**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
This is the CONCRETE EXAMPLE students need. Spend 3 minutes.

Ask: "Can anyone think of another example where we could ask both types of questions?" (Christmas: Functionalist = creates family bonds, consumer economy. Substantive = celebrating Christ's birth, theological meaning of incarnation.)

---

### SLIDE 47: Tylor and Frazer—Historical Context

## Early Substantive Theorists: [POPUP_TRIGGER id="tylor"]Edward Tylor[/POPUP_TRIGGER] (1832-1917) and [POPUP_TRIGGER id="frazer"]James Frazer[/POPUP_TRIGGER] (1854-1941)

[POPUP id="tylor"]
**Edward Tylor (1832-1917)**

British anthropologist, pioneer in cultural evolution theory. Coined term "animism" to describe belief in spiritual beings. Argued religion evolved from simple to complex forms.

Major work: *Primitive Culture* (1871). Used term "primitive" to describe "earlier stages" of cultural evolution—now rejected as ethnocentric and colonialist.
[/POPUP]

[POPUP id="frazer"]
**James Frazer (1854-1941)**

Scottish anthropologist and folklorist. Compiled massive cross-cultural study of myth, magic, and ritual.

Major work: *The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion* (13 volumes, 1890-1915). Influenced by evolutionary assumptions now considered problematic.
[/POPUP]

**Why they're here (and why this is *not* the last word):**

We place Tylor and Frazer under the **substantive** side here because they offered *content-based* accounts of what religion is (e.g., spirits, magic), even though their evolutionary assumptions are now widely rejected.

**Their Arguments:**

◆ Religious belief originated as explanations of natural phenomena

◆ Beliefs in spirits attempt to explain life and death

◆ Myths and deities attempt to explain other natural phenomena (thunder, seasons, etc.)

◆ Religion evolved from "primitive" forms to monotheism and eventually to science

**Major Work:** James Frazer, *The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion* (13 volumes!)

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER]
📸 **Image needed:** "The Golden Bough book cover vintage"  
*Frazer's influential work*

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Spend 2 minutes on this slide, then CRITICAL CONTEXT next slide.

Set up: "Tylor and Frazer were hugely influential, but we need to understand the problematic assumptions they brought..."

---

### SLIDE 48: Critical Context—Colonial Assumptions

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CONTEXT: Why We Study Them

[WARNING_BOX]
Tylor and Frazer used the term **"primitive"**—a problematic word reflecting **19th-century colonial assumptions**.

Their evolutionary model is now **widely rejected by scholars** because it:

◆ Wrongly assumed European Christianity was the "highest" form of religion

◆ Wrongly assumed indigenous traditions were "lesser" or "earlier stages"

◆ Reflected colonial attitudes that justified domination and "civilizing missions"

◆ Imposed Western categories (belief, monotheism, scripture) on all traditions
[/WARNING_BOX]

**We study Tylor and Frazer to understand the history of Religious Studies, NOT because their conclusions are correct.**

**What we learn from them:**

✅ The importance of cross-cultural comparison (good method)

✅ Attention to symbolism in myth and ritual (good insight)

❌ Evolutionary hierarchies are ethnocentric (bad conclusion)

❌ "Primitive/advanced" language is colonial (bad framing)

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
This revision is CRITICAL based on analysis. Spend 3 minutes.

Don't skip the context paragraph—it prevents students from absorbing colonialist assumptions.

Emphasize: "We learn from their mistakes as well as their insights. The discipline has evolved by recognizing and correcting these errors."

If students ask why we study them at all: "Understanding how the discipline developed—including its mistakes—makes us better scholars. We see how assumptions shape conclusions."

---

### SLIDE 49: Think-Pair-Share Activity

## Applying Functionalist vs. Substantive

[DISCUSSION_PROMPT]
**Turn to a partner (3 minutes):**

Think of a religious practice you know (prayer, meditation, pilgrimage, fasting, etc.).

Formulate:
1. One **FUNCTIONALIST** question you could ask about it (What does it DO?)
2. One **SUBSTANTIVE** question you could ask about it (What does it MEAN?)

**After 2 minutes:** Be ready to share with the class.
[/DISCUSSION_PROMPT]

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
This cements the distinction through application. Give full 3 minutes.

Listen for understanding: Are students asking the right *type* of question?

If students struggle, offer prompts:
- "Functionalist = What effect does this have on society or the individual?"
- "Substantive = What is the practitioner trying to accomplish or express?"

Call on 2-3 pairs to share.

---

### SLIDE 50: History of Religious Studies [SECTION]

# How Did Religious Studies Emerge?

From theology to academic discipline

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Transition: "We've looked at WHAT scholars study (functionalism vs. substantive). Now let's trace HOW the academic field of Religious Studies developed."

This gives historical context for methods.

---

### SLIDE 51: Disciplinary History [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]

## Theology → Comparative Religion → Religious Studies

**Before 19th Century:**

◆ Religion studied primarily through **theology** (from within traditions)

◆ Christian scholars studied Christianity; Muslim scholars studied Islam; etc.

◆ Goal: Deepen faith, defend orthodoxy, interpret scripture

**19th Century: The "Science of Religion" Emerges**

◆ Scholars began studying religion **comparatively** (across traditions)

◆ Applied social scientific methods (history, anthropology, sociology)

◆ Aimed for **descriptive** rather than **prescriptive** approach

◆ Key figures: Max Müller (philology), Cornelius Tiele (phenomenology)

**20th Century: Institutionalization**

◆ Religious Studies departments separate from theology schools

◆ Development of methods: phenomenology, history of religions

◆ Debates: Can you study religion "objectively"? Should you?

**21st Century: Critical Turns**

◆ Postcolonial critique (acknowledging Western bias)

◆ Attention to power, gender, race in religious contexts

◆ New areas: digital religion, material religion, lived religion

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Spend 3 minutes.

Shows students: Religious Studies has a HISTORY—it's not timeless.

The field has evolved by recognizing and correcting its own biases.

Preview: "Now let's look at specific methods scholars use..."

---

### SLIDE 52: Historical-Critical Method

## Method #1: Historical-Critical Approach

**What It Is:**

◆ Studies the process of a religion's beginnings, growth, diversity, and decline

◆ Uses tools like: archaeology, textual analysis in original languages, historical contextualization

◆ Treats religious texts as historical documents (when written? by whom? for what audience? in what context?)

**Example Applications:**

◆ Dating biblical manuscripts

◆ Tracing the development of Buddhist texts across centuries

◆ Analyzing how Qur'anic interpretation changed over time

◆ Understanding religious movements in their historical-political contexts

[GRID_COMPARISON]
**LEFT:**
### Strengths:

◆ Grounds religion in concrete history

◆ Reveals how traditions change over time

◆ Uncovers influences between traditions

**RIGHT:**
### Limitations:

◆ Can miss what religion *means* to practitioners today

◆ May reduce religion to "just" historical phenomena
[/GRID_COMPARISON]

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Spend 2 minutes.

Frame as ONE tool among many.

Quick example: "The Dead Sea Scrolls discovery (1947) revolutionized understanding of early Judaism and the context for early Christianity. Historical-critical method made that possible."

---

### SLIDE 53: History of Religions School

## Method #2: History of Religions (Religionswissenschaft)

**What It Is:**

◆ Studies religion as a **social and cultural phenomenon**

◆ Comparative approach: looks for patterns across traditions

◆ Interdisciplinary: draws from anthropology, sociology, history, philology

**Approach:**

◆ Examines how religions emerge in specific cultural contexts

◆ Traces influences, borrowings, and interactions between traditions

◆ Studies religion's role in society

**Example:**

◆ Comparing creation myths across cultures

◆ Tracing how Buddhism adapted as it spread from India → China → Japan

◆ Analyzing how Christianity changed when it entered new cultural contexts

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Spend 1.5 minutes.

Don't dwell too long—students just need basic awareness.

Note: This is comparative but historical (differs from phenomenology which emphasizes empathy/experience).

---
### SLIDE 53A: Ethnography and Fieldwork (Lived Religion as Method)

## Method Add-on: Ethnography / Fieldwork

Some scholars study religion by observing and interviewing people in real settings—homes, temples, churches, festivals, online communities.

**Typical tools:**
- Participant observation (watching and taking fieldnotes; sometimes participating)
- Interviews (structured or informal conversations)
- Material/space analysis (objects, clothing, food, architecture)
- Ethics + consent (protecting people; avoiding harm)
- Reflexivity (noticing how *you* shape what you see)

**Key takeaway:** Ethnography helps you study **lived religion**—what people actually do, not only what texts or leaders say.
---

### SLIDE 54: Phenomenology of Religion

## Method #3: [POPUP_TRIGGER id="phenomenology"]Phenomenology of Religion[/POPUP_TRIGGER]

[POPUP id="phenomenology"]
**Phenomenology of Religion**

An approach that seeks to describe religions empathetically "in their own terms" from the standpoint of practitioners.

Key principles:
- Epoché (bracketing): Suspend your own judgments
- Empathy: Understand from inside perspective
- Irreducibility: Religion has its own distinct character
- Comparison: Look for universal patterns

Major figures: Rudolf Otto, Gerardus van der Leeuw, Mircea Eliade, Ninian Smart.

Critiqued for potentially essentializing religion or smuggling in theological assumptions.
[/POPUP]

**Core Principles:**

**1. Empathetic Standpoint**

Seeks to describe religions **in their own terms** from a standpoint that is empathetic with practitioners

Phenomenologists argue that religion is best approached by starting from the standpoint of practitioners—describing before judging—while recognizing that complete neutrality is impossible.

**2. [POPUP_TRIGGER id="epoche"]Bracketing (Epoché)[/POPUP_TRIGGER]**

Temporarily suspend your own beliefs and judgments

"Bracket" questions of truth/falsehood to focus on *what religion means to practitioners*

**Quick check:** Bracketing does **not** mean agreeing—it means suspending judgment long enough to describe carefully.

[POPUP id="epoche"]
**Epoché (ἐποχή)**

Greek philosophical term meaning "suspension" or "holding back."

In phenomenology: The practice of temporarily setting aside (bracketing) your own beliefs, judgments, and assumptions to focus purely on describing phenomena as they appear to consciousness.

Example: Don't ask "Is God real?" Ask "What is the experience of encountering God like for this practitioner?"
[/POPUP]

**3. Irreducibility of the Sacred**

Religion cannot be fully explained by psychology, sociology, economics, or history alone

Religion has its own distinct character

**4. Comparative Focus**

Seeks out aspects of religious life that are universal or essential

Example: experience of the sacred across cultures

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Spend 3 minutes.

This is dense—needs concrete example (next slide).

---

### SLIDE 55: Phenomenology—Concrete Example

## Phenomenology in Practice: What Does It Look Like?

**Imagine:** You're watching someone meditate.

[GRID_COMPARISON]
**LEFT:**
### Other Approaches Say:

**A psychologist might say:**

"They're reducing anxiety through controlled breathing and mindfulness techniques."

**A sociologist might say:**

"They're performing group identity as a member of a Buddhist community."

**A historian might say:**

"This practice developed in ancient India and spread via trade routes."

**RIGHT:**
### A Phenomenologist Says:

**"Wait—let's first understand what the meditator themselves thinks is happening."**

◆ What's their experience *from the inside*?

◆ What do they believe they're doing?

◆ What does it feel like to them?

◆ How do they describe the goal/purpose?

The phenomenologist temporarily sets aside external explanations (brackets them) to really listen to and describe the practitioner's own perspective.
[/GRID_COMPARISON]

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
This concrete example is CRITICAL. Spend 3 minutes.

Ask: "Does this make sense? Phenomenology is about understanding experience from the inside, in the terms practitioners themselves use."

Acknowledge the challenge: "Total bracketing is impossible—we all have assumptions. But the *effort* to bracket makes us better listeners and more accurate describers."

---

### SLIDE 56: Mircea Eliade [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]

## [POPUP_TRIGGER id="eliade"]Mircea Eliade[/POPUP_TRIGGER] (1907-1986): Key Phenomenologist

[POPUP id="eliade"]
**Mircea Eliade (1907-1986)**

Romanian historian of religions and University of Chicago professor. One of the most influential phenomenologists of religion in the 20th century.

Major works: *The Myth of the Eternal Return* (1949), *The Sacred and the Profane* (1959), *Patterns in Comparative Religion* (1958).

Argued that religion has irreducible essence (the sacred) that appears in universal patterns across cultures. Critiqued for essentializing and ignoring power/history.
[/POPUP]

**Major Works:**

◆ *The Myth of the Eternal Return* (1949)

◆ *The Sacred and the Profane* (1959)

**Eliade's Arguments:**

**1. Irreducibility of the Sacred**

Religious phenomena must be understood as uniquely and irreducibly religious

Religion expresses meaning on a *religious* plane of reference

Cannot reduce religion to psychological, social, economic, or historical factors alone

**2. Dialectic of the Sacred and Profane**

Religion involves the experience of the transcendent (sacred, infinite, eternal) manifesting through ordinary (profane, finite, temporal) phenomena

Examples: How can the infinite God appear in bread and wine (Eucharist)? How can the eternal manifest in a specific historical event?

**3. Universal Symbolic Systems**

Human beings are *homo religiosus* and *homo symbolicus* (religious and symbolic beings)

We use symbolic language to express transcendent meanings

Common symbols (water, sky, earth, center) appear across cultures with similar meanings

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER]
📸 **Image needed:** "Mircea Eliade portrait photograph"  
*Romanian-American historian of religions*

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Spend 3 minutes.

Eliade is hugely influential but also contested—include critique (next slide).

---

### SLIDE 57: Critiques of Eliade

## Phenomenology: Strengths and Critiques

[GRID_COMPARISON]
**LEFT:**
### Strengths:

✅ Takes practitioners seriously on their own terms

✅ Attends to religious experience, not just external structures

✅ Resists reductive explanations

✅ Comparative insights across traditions

**RIGHT:**
### Critiques of Eliade & Phenomenology:

❌ Accused of "crypto-theology"—smuggling religious assumptions into supposedly neutral scholarship

❌ May essentialize religion (assume all religions share a universal core)

❌ Can ignore power dynamics, history, and cultural context

❌ "Bracketing" is harder than it sounds—can we really suspend our worldview?

❌ May privilege elite/textual religion over lived practice
[/GRID_COMPARISON]

**Contemporary Approach:**

Most scholars today use **multiple methods**—historical, sociological, phenomenological—recognizing each has strengths and limitations.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Spend 2 minutes.

Show students: scholarly methods are debated, not settled.

Emphasize: "Even giants like Eliade are contested. That's how scholarship works—we build on AND critique what came before."

Transition: "Now let's look at some contemporary developments..."

---

### SLIDE 58: Maps and Methodological Self-Awareness [SECTION]

# Critical Awareness

Examining our own tools

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Transition: "We've examined theories and methods. Now a meta-question: How do we think critically about our OWN analytical frameworks?"

---

### SLIDE 59: Map Is Not Territory

## "Map Is Not Territory" — [POPUP_TRIGGER id="jz-smith"]Jonathan Z. Smith[/POPUP_TRIGGER]

[POPUP id="jz-smith"]
**Jonathan Z. Smith (1938-2017)**

American historian of religions, University of Chicago. Known for deconstructing taken-for-granted categories in religious studies.

Major work: *Map Is Not Territory: Studies in the History of Religions* (1978). Argued that "religion" is a scholarly construct, not a natural kind. Categories like "world religions," "myth," "ritual" are our maps, not objective territories.

Influenced postmodern and critical approaches to religious studies.
[/POPUP]

Scholar **Jonathan Z. Smith** wrote: **"Map is not territory."**

**What This Means:**

All our frameworks—"world religions," "myth," "ritual," "functionalism," "phenomenology"—are **maps** we've drawn to help navigate complex terrain.

**The map is useful, but it's not the same as the actual territory.**

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER]
📸 **Image needed:** "antique world map with blank spaces"  
*Historical map showing constructed nature of cartography*

**Implications for Religious Studies:**

As we study, ask yourself:

◆ Who created this category? When? Why?

◆ What does this framework highlight, and what does it hide?

◆ How might practitioners themselves describe their tradition differently?

◆ What assumptions am I bringing to this analysis?

**This kind of [KEY_TERM]methodological self-awareness[/KEY_TERM] is what separates academic study from tourism or prejudice.**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
This is NEW content. Spend 2-3 minutes.

Critical thinking skill: examine your own tools, not just the object of study.

Brings course full circle back to "world religions paradigm" critique from Day 1.

Example: "When we call something a 'myth,' we're using OUR category. The tradition itself might call it 'revealed truth,' 'sacred history,' or have no single label. Recognizing this doesn't mean our categories are useless—just that they're constructed tools, not nature."

---
### SLIDE 59A: Religion, Power, and Discourse

## Why “maps” matter socially (not just academically)

Definitions of “religion” can shape real lives because institutions use them.

**Examples of power at work:**
- Governments decide what counts as a religion (or not) for legal recognition
- Schools, courts, and prisons decide which practices get protected or accommodated
- Media labels some groups “religion,” others “cult,” “superstition,” or “culture”

**Analytic move:** Ask who benefits from a definition—and who gets excluded.
---

### SLIDE 60: Digital Religion [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]

## Contemporary Approach: [POPUP_TRIGGER id="digital-religion"]Digital Religion[/POPUP_TRIGGER]

[POPUP id="digital-religion"]
**Digital Religion**

The study of how religion operates in and through digital media—social media, streaming, apps, virtual communities, online rituals.

Key questions:
- How do online and offline religious lives blend?
- Does virtual community = real community?
- How do algorithms shape religious identity?
- How do platforms (rules, moderation, monetization) act as gatekeepers of authority?
- Can you have authentic religion mediated by technology?

**Recent pattern:** For many communities, *hybrid* online/offline religious life is now normal (especially since 2020).

Major scholars: Heidi Campbell, Ruth Tsuria. Post-2020 (COVID-19), this exploded as livestreamed worship became necessity.
[/POPUP]

**How Has Technology Changed Religion?**

Consider:

◆ Livestreamed worship services (especially post-2020 pandemic)

◆ Prayer apps that remind Muslims of salat times or guide Buddhist meditation

◆ Online communities (Reddit forums, Facebook groups) where people discuss faith

◆ Religious influencers on TikTok, YouTube, Instagram

◆ Virtual pilgrimage sites (tour Mecca or Jerusalem from home)

◆ AI-generated sermons or spiritual guidance

**Study of Digital Religion asks:**

◆ How do online and offline religious lives blend together?

◆ Does praying through an app "count" the same as praying in person?

◆ Do virtual communities create the same bonds as physical congregations?

◆ How does algorithm-driven content shape religious identity?

**This isn't just modern gimmicks**—it's how millions practice today.

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER]
📸 **Image needed:** "person using prayer app smartphone mosque"  
*Muslim using digital prayer app*

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
This is NEW content. Spend 2-3 minutes.

Connects to students' lived experience.

Optional: Ask "How many of you have participated in religion online?" (show of hands)—then discuss.

Normalize: "This is legitimate religious expression worthy of scholarly study, not a 'lesser' version."

---

### SLIDE 61: Evidence and Academic Writing

## What Counts as Evidence in Religious Studies?

When you write papers or make arguments in this class, **good evidence includes:**

✅ **Primary sources:**
◆ Sacred texts (Bible, Qur'an, Vedas, etc.)
◆ First-hand accounts from practitioners
◆ Historical documents
◆ Ethnographic observations

✅ **Secondary sources:**
◆ Scholarly books and peer-reviewed journal articles
◆ Reputable news sources (for contemporary events)
◆ Documentary films by credentialed scholars

❌ **NOT good evidence:**
◆ "I think..." or "I feel..." (personal opinion without support)
◆ "Everyone knows..." (unexamined assumptions)
◆ Stereotypes from media or hearsay
◆ Random websites without scholarly credentials

**Academic Writing Tip:**

❌ Instead of: "I think Buddhism is peaceful"

✅ Write: "Scholar X argues that Buddhist ethics emphasize ahimsa (non-harm), as evidenced by texts such as the Dhammapada."

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
This is NEW content. Spend 2 minutes.

Sets expectations for assignments.

Students need explicit instruction on evidence—many come from high school where "I think" was acceptable.

---

### SLIDE 62: Language of Respectful Disagreement

## How to Engage Critically While Respecting People

You may encounter beliefs or practices you find strange, wrong, or troubling. **That's okay.**

Academic study means we can critique ideas while respecting people.

[GRID_COMPARISON]
**LEFT:**
### ❌ Instead of this...

"That's crazy/stupid/backwards"

"They're wrong"

"I can't believe anyone would..."

"That doesn't make sense"

**RIGHT:**
### ✅ Try this...

"From an outsider's perspective, this practice seems..."

"A critic might argue..." or "This claim is contested by..."

"This challenges my own assumptions about..."

"This operates according to a different logic than I'm familiar with..."
[/GRID_COMPARISON]

**You can:**

✅ Analyze power dynamics (e.g., patriarchy in religious institutions)

✅ Critique specific ideas or practices using evidence

✅ Note contradictions or ethical concerns

✅ Disagree respectfully

**You should avoid:**

❌ Blanket dismissals of entire traditions

❌ Assuming superiority of your own worldview

❌ Reducing people to stereotypes

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
This is NEW content. Spend 2-3 minutes.

Models how to be critical without being dismissive.

Empowers students to engage rather than staying silent out of fear of offense.

Example: "You can say 'This text reflects patriarchal assumptions common in ancient contexts' without saying 'This religion hates women.'"

### SLIDE 63: Workshop Introduction [SECTION]

# In-Class Workshop

Applying What We've Learned

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Transition: "Now it's time to put everything together. We'll work through case studies applying Chapter 1 concepts."

---

### SLIDE 64: Workshop Activity

## Case Study Workshop

**You'll work in small groups (3-4 students) on a case study.**

**Your task:**

1. Read the case study (provided on handout)
2. Identify which concepts from Chapter 1 apply
3. Answer the questions using course vocabulary
4. Be prepared to share with the class

**Case Study Options:**

◆ **Case A:** A Hindu pilgrimage to the Ganges River

◆ **Case B:** A Muslim student navigating Ramadan fasting on a college campus

◆ **Case C:** An indigenous tradition blending Christianity with ancestral practices

◆ **Case D:** A Buddhist meditation app with 10 million users

**You have 10 minutes to work. Then we'll discuss as a class.**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Distribute handouts with case studies (see separate workshop document).

Form groups of 3-4 students.

Set timer for 10 minutes.

Circulate and listen to group discussions—this is formative assessment.

If time is short, do this as whole-class discussion instead of group work.

---

### SLIDE 65: Workshop Debrief [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]

## Group Sharing

**Each group shares (30 seconds each):**

◆ Which case study did you work on?

◆ What was one key insight you had?

◆ Which concept from Chapter 1 was most helpful for understanding your case?

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Call on each group (or volunteer groups if short on time).

Listen for: Are they using course vocabulary correctly?

Affirm good insights.

Gently correct misunderstandings.

This is informal formative assessment—gauge what stuck and what needs review.

---

### SLIDE 66: Chapter 1 Summary [SECTION]

# Chapter 1 Complete

What we've accomplished

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Final wrap-up. Celebrate what students have learned.

---
