---

## SLIDE 1: Organizing the Church

- After publication of the Book of Mormon, the **Church of Christ** is organized in **Fayette, New York, April 6, 1830** (later Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints).  
- Persecution begins quickly; Joseph Smith charged with disorderly conduct and acquitted.  
- Highly active proselytizing church:  
  - Many male converts sent out as missionaries.  
- **Sidney Rigdon**, a Campbellite minister in Kirtland, Ohio, converts and brings ~100 members with him.  
- Smith moves Church headquarters to **Kirtland, Ohio**.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Link to broader American themes: religious entrepreneurship, voluntary associations, and frontier charisma.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Early pattern: organize → face persecution → move → grow through missionary work. This repeats throughout early LDS history.

## [SECTION] Building Zion: Community and Conflict

## SLIDE 2: City of Zion and the Gathering

- Independence, Missouri, identified as the **City of Zion**.  
- Converts encouraged to gather to **Kirtland** or **Independence**.  
- Highlights Mormonism's connection to:  
  - Founding actual cities.  
  - Exercising civic power.  

### Purposes of Gathering

- Prepare for the **Second Coming of Christ**.  
- Establish a righteous community.  
- Build temples for sacred ordinances.  

- **Kirtland Temple** is constructed as the first LDS temple.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Compare "gathering" to other utopian or communitarian experiments in 19th‑century America.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** "Gathering" = core LDS practice. Not just spiritual community but actual cities with political/economic power.

---

## SLIDE 3: Anti-Mormon Pogroms and Violence

- Plans to build Zion repeatedly thwarted by violence.  
- Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon **tarred and feathered** in 1833.  
- In Jackson County, Missouri, Mormons suffer:  
  - Tar and feathers, whippings.  
  - Crops burned, roofs destroyed.  
  - Cabins burned and cattle driven off.  
- Mormons flee to Clay County, then again to more remote areas in northern Missouri.

### "Pogrom" Defined

- **Pogrom**: mob attack, condoned by authorities, against persons and property of a religious, racial, or national minority.

[WARNING_BOX: This is actual religious violence, not just disagreement]

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Stress that persecution and violence are part of this story. Avoid simple "Mormons good / enemies bad" narratives; acknowledge complex local tensions.

---

## SLIDE 4: Mormon War, 1838

- With little legal protection, some Mormons organize the **Danites**, a group formed to defend property and expel dissenters.  
- Tensions escalate into open conflict known as the **Mormon War of 1838**.  
- Missouri governor **Lilburn Boggs** issues the infamous **"Extermination Order"**:  
  > "The Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State if necessary for the public peace…"

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** "Extermination Order" = government-sanctioned religious persecution. Shows how NRMs can face extreme opposition.

---

## SLIDE 5: Haun's Mill Massacre

- October 30, 1838: armed Missourians attack the Mormon settlement at **Haun's Mill**.  
- The community is unprepared; attackers kill those who cannot escape.  
- Seventeen people are killed, including children.  
- Mormons are forced to flee the state of Missouri.

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Memorial or historical marker for Haun's Mill]

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Use this as an example of how religious minorities can be violently targeted, and how governments sometimes participate.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Haun's Mill = example of extreme anti-Mormon violence. 17 killed, including children. Led to Mormon exodus from Missouri.

---

## [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## SLIDE 6: Understanding Religious Violence

**DISCUSSION_PROMPT:**
Why might established communities react violently to new religious movements? Consider:
- Economic competition
- Political power
- Religious differences
- Social cohesion

Share insights with a partner, then with the class.

## [SECTION] Nauvoo: Power and Controversy

## SLIDE 7: Nauvoo Period

- Mormons welcomed by people of Illinois.  
- Found the city of **Nauvoo** on swampy land along the Mississippi River.  
- 1840: Nauvoo chartered by state government, with:  
  - Home rule.  
  - Local militia.  
- Joseph Smith serves as **mayor** and **militia leader**.  
- Within four years, Nauvoo grows to nearly the size of Chicago.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Ask students to think about how rapid demographic and political change might alarm neighboring communities.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Nauvoo = Mormon city-state. Joseph Smith holds religious AND political power. Recipe for conflict with neighbors.

---

## SLIDE 8: Polygamy (Plural Marriage)

- Smith begins introducing **polygamy** quietly during Nauvoo period.  
- At first **not openly taught**; rumors spread and create division.  
- Emma Smith (Joseph's wife) is at times ambivalent, at times strongly opposed.  
- Joseph takes multiple wives; some relationships are non-conjugal.  
- After migration to Utah, polygamy is openly taught and practiced.  
- Long conflict with U.S. federal government over polygamy.  
- Officially discontinued in **1890** (LDS Church issues a Manifesto).

[POPUP: "Non-conjugal" = marriage for religious/social purposes without sexual relationship]

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Present polygamy neutrally but clearly; distinguish between past LDS practice, present LDS teaching, and splinter groups that continue it.

---

## SLIDE 9: Martyrdom of Joseph Smith

- Disaffected Mormons publish an anti-Mormon newspaper, the **Nauvoo Expositor**.  
- Nauvoo city council orders the press destroyed.  
- Joseph Smith is arrested and taken to **Carthage Jail** to face charges.  
- While in jail, Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum are shot and killed by a mob.  
- No one is convicted for the killings.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Emphasize both the violence of the mob and Joseph's controversial use of civic power; it's a collision of religious authority and American legal norms.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Joseph Smith killed in jail by mob (1844). Martyr to Mormons, but his destruction of press was legally questionable.

## [SECTION] The Utah Era and Distinctive Beliefs

## SLIDE 10: Pioneer Era and the Westward Movement

### Brigham Young and the Trek West

- After Smith's death, **Brigham Young** is chosen as successor and regarded as a prophet.  
- Organizes the **trek to Utah Territory** and colonizes the mountain West.  
- An estimated **80,000 pioneers** travel by wagon or on foot before railroads.  
- Utah Territory acquired by the United States in 1848.  
- Brings LDS Church into conflict with the U.S. government over polygamy and governance.

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Mormon pioneer wagon train or handcart company]

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Brigham Young leads Mormons to Utah (1847). Isolated location allows them to practice religion freely... for a while.

---

## SLIDE 11: Utah War and Mountain Meadows

### Utah War (1857–1858)

- President **James Buchanan** dispatches federal troops to Utah in 1857.  
- Partly motivated by national politics, including debates over slavery and federal authority.  
- At height of tensions, the **Mountain Meadows Massacre** occurs in Sept. 1857, when a group of local Mormon militia and allies kill a large emigrant party.

### Textbook Errors to Note

- Brigham Young was the first **territorial** governor of Utah, but he was **not** the first **state** governor.  
- The Mountain Meadows Massacre was **part of** the Utah War context, **not** its cause.

**SPEAKER NOTES:** This is a sensitive and complicated story. Acknowledge LDS and non-LDS scholarship on Mountain Meadows; emphasize historiographical complexity, not simple blame narratives.

## [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## SLIDE 12: Pattern Recognition

**GRID_COMPARISON:**
| Phase | Location | Key Challenge | Response |
|-------|----------|---------------|----------|
| Early | New York/Ohio | Local persecution | Move west |
| Missouri | Missouri | State-sanctioned violence | Flee to Illinois |
| Nauvoo | Illinois | Political power concerns | Trek to Utah |
| Utah | Utah Territory | Federal authority | Eventual accommodation |

**Question:** What patterns do you see in how the LDS Church responded to challenges?

## SLIDE 13: Distinctive Teachings of the LDS Church

- Christian denomination, but with important distinctions from mainstream Protestant and Catholic doctrines.

## Articles of Faith (Selected Themes)

- **(1)** Rejects traditional creedal concept of the **Trinity**; affirms three distinct divine personages.  
- **(2)** Rejects doctrine of **original sin** in its classic Western form.  
- **(3)** Emphasizes salvation by **grace and works together**.  
- **(6)** Teaches **apostasy and restoration** of the Church through Joseph Smith.  
- **(8–9)** Rejects a **closed canon**; accepts ongoing scripture and revelation.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Key LDS differences: No Trinity, no original sin, grace + works, ongoing revelation, restoration not reformation.

---

## SLIDE 14: Standard Works and Practices

## Standard Works (Scriptures)

- Bible (King James Version in English-speaking LDS context).  
- Book of Mormon.  
- Doctrine and Covenants.  
- Pearl of Great Price.

## Ethical and Lifestyle Codes

- **Word of Wisdom** – health code (no alcohol, tobacco, coffee/tea, harmful drugs; encourage wholesome diet).  
- **Law of Chastity** – no sexual relations outside of marriage; absolute fidelity within marriage.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Four scriptures (Bible + 3 more). Strict lifestyle codes including dietary restrictions (Word of Wisdom).

---

## SLIDE 15: Distinctive Practices

- Lay leadership (unpaid local clergy).  
- Strong missionary program.  
- **Temple worship** (distinct from regular Sunday worship):  
  - Baptism for the dead.  
  - Endowment ceremony.  
  - Sealing of families.  
  - Sacred temple clothing.

[WARNING_BOX: Temple ceremonies are sacred to LDS members; discuss respectfully]

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Clarify that only certain members in good standing participate in temple rites; most LDS meetings occur in regular meetinghouses, not temples.

---

## [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## SLIDE 16: Day 2 Synthesis

**DISCUSSION_PROMPT:**
How do the distinctive beliefs and practices of the LDS Church both connect to and diverge from mainstream Christianity? What role might persecution have played in strengthening these distinctions?

**Homework Preview:**
- Read materials on Scientology and contemporary NRM issues
- Think about: How do 20th century NRMs differ from 19th century ones?

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** LDS story shows pattern: new revelation → community building → conflict → adaptation. Watch for this in other NRMs!
