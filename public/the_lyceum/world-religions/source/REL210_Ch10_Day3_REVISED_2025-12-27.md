[SECTION: Jewish Law in Practice]

## SLIDE 1: The Law of Moses - Overview

### Foundation of Jewish Practice

The Law (Torah) contains:
- Stories and commandments for life and death
- Rabbis enumerate **613 commandments** (mitzvot)
- All commandments believed to come from God

Categories include:
- **Ten Commandments** - Foundational moral law
- **Sacrifices and offerings** - Temple worship (historical)
- **Holiness Code** - Comprehensive life guidance (Leviticus 17-26)

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Emphasize that for Judaism, law is not "legalism" but a path of holiness and covenant faithfulness.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** 613 = 365 negative ("don't do") + 248 positive ("do") commandments. Covers every aspect of life!

## SLIDE 2: The Ten Commandments - Context

### Liberation Before Law

**Given at Mount Sinai after deliverance from Egypt**

**Preamble:**
> "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."

**Key insights:**
- Ethical monotheism rooted in **liberation**: God frees slaves, then gives law
- God is source of morality, above human opinion
- Most commandments concern how we treat others
- Freedom depends on **moral self-control**
- God cares deeply about human beings (His creation)

## SLIDE 3: Duties to God (Commandments 1-4)

### First Table of the Law

**Commandment 1 – No Other Gods**
- "You shall have no other gods before Me"
- One God → one human race → one moral standard
- When false gods are worshipped, injustice and oppression follow

**Commandment 2 – No Idols** (not shown in original text)

**Commandment 3 – Name of God**
- Hebrew: "Do not **carry** the name of the LORD your God in vain"
- Includes: swearing falsely by God, using God's name to justify evil

**Commandment 4 – Sabbath**
- "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy"
- Friday sunset to Saturday sunset
- Prohibits work for all, including slaves and animals
- Re-creates **sacred time**

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Ask students for examples of doing evil "in God's name" historically and today.

---

## SLIDE 4: Duties to Others (Commandments 5-10)

### Second Table of the Law

**Interpersonal Ethics:**

5. **Honor your father and mother**
6. **You shall not murder**
7. **You shall not commit adultery**
8. **You shall not steal**
9. **You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor**
10. **You shall not covet**

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Highlight how these form the backbone of later Jewish and Christian ethics, and many modern legal norms.

[DISCUSSION_PROMPT: "Which of these commandments might be hardest to keep in modern society? Why?"]

---

## SLIDE 5: [ASSESSMENT_BREAK] Applying the Commandments

### Case Study Exercise

**For each scenario, identify which commandment(s) apply:**

1. Posting false information about someone on social media
   [POPUP: #9 - False witness]

2. Working your employees 7 days a week with no rest
   [POPUP: #4 - Sabbath principle of rest for all]

3. Using religious language to justify violence
   [POPUP: #3 - Taking God's name in vain]

4. Being jealous of neighbor's possessions and plotting to get them
   [POPUP: #10 - Coveting, possibly leading to #8 - Stealing]

---

[SECTION: From Sacrifice to Holiness]

## SLIDE 6: Sacrifices and Offerings

### Temple-Era Practice

**Levitical Priesthood:**
- **Moses and Aaron** from tribe of **Levi**
- Tribe of **Levi** receives no land inheritance
- Instead, Levites become **priestly tribe**

**Priests (sons of Aaron) responsible for:**
- Performing sacrifices
- Maintaining ritual purity
- Teaching the law

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Transition here to discuss how sacrifice functions as symbolic communication with God—then how it is later replaced by prayer and good deeds after Temple destruction.

## SLIDE 7: The Holiness Code - Overview

### Living Sacred Lives (Leviticus 19+)

**Core Principle:**
> "You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy" (Lev 19:2)

**Holiness** = sacred, set apart, separate from the profane

**The Code Contains:**
- Secular regulations
- Ritual regulations
- Moral and ethical injunctions
- Festival and calendar laws
- Dietary restrictions (**kosher**)
- Sexual restrictions

**Key Theme:** Avoid profane practices; holiness is lived in concrete actions

---

## SLIDE 8: Holiness in Practice

### Examples from the Holiness Code

[GRID_COMPARISON:
| Category | Specific Laws | Underlying Value |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| Economic Justice | Leave corners of fields for poor | Compassion, sharing wealth |
| Honest Business | Just weights and measures | Integrity in commerce |
| Social Relations | Don't gossip or hold grudges | Community harmony |
| Worship | No mixing of kinds (fabric, seeds) | Maintaining distinctions |
| Food | Separate meat and dairy | Sanctifying daily life |]

**SPEAKER NOTES:** A good closing activity: have students find one rule from the Holiness Code and explain what value it is trying to protect (life, justice, purity, compassion, etc.).

---

## SLIDE 9: Kosher Laws

### Dietary Holiness

**Basic Principles:**
- Only certain animals permitted (split hooves + chew cud for mammals)
- No mixing meat and dairy
- Ritual slaughter required
- No blood consumption
- Separate dishes/utensils for meat and dairy

**Purpose:**
- Distinguish Jewish people
- Make eating a conscious, holy act
- Reminder of covenant relationship
- Creates community bonds

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:** Kosher = "fit" or "proper." It's about making everyday acts (eating) into spiritual practices.

---

## SLIDE 10: [ASSESSMENT_BREAK] Holiness Code Analysis

### Critical Thinking Exercise

**Read Leviticus 19:9-18 and identify:**

1. **Three ethical commands that apply universally**
   [POPUP: Love neighbor, don't steal, just weights, etc.]

2. **Two ritual commands specific to ancient Israel**
   [POPUP: Sacrifices, ritual purity laws]

3. **One command that bridges ethics and ritual**
   [POPUP: Sabbath observance - both rest and holiness]

**Discussion:** How does mixing ethical and ritual law strengthen religious practice?

[SECTION: Messianic Hope and Modern Judaism]

## SLIDE 11: Jewish Messianic Expectation

### The Anointed One

**Messiah** (mashiach) = "anointed one"

**Traditional Jewish Expectations:**

- Will establish era of peace and justice
- Rebuild the Temple
- Gather Jewish exiles

**Key prophetic passages:**

**SPEAKER NOTES:** Connect to later differences with Christian claims about Jesus as messiah.
