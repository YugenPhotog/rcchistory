# Christianity
## Chapter 11

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> This lecture tracks Christianity from its origins as a Jewish renewal movement to a global, internally diverse religion. Keep connecting each historical shift to changes in power, doctrine, and practice.

## SLIDE 2

# Names: Christianity

- Daughter religion to Judaism  
- "Judeo-Christianity" / Christianity  
- Religion based on Jesus Christ's life and teaching  
- Jesus of Nazareth as central figure  
- **Shared Beliefs with Judaism:** one God, Hebrew Scriptures, covenant language  
- **Distinguishing Features:**  
  - Jesus as Messiah (Hebrew) / Christ (Greek) – the Anointed One  
  - Christian liberty / salvation in Christ

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Emphasize continuity *and* rupture with Judaism. Students often assume total break; highlight early Jesus movement as Jewish.

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**  
> Remember: Christianity began WITHIN Judaism, not against it. Key difference: Jesus as Messiah/Christ.

## SLIDE 3

# The Christian Present as Shaped by Its Past

[POPUP: Why History Matters]
- Modern denominations emerge from historical conflicts
- Contemporary doctrines developed over centuries
- Current practices reflect past struggles
- Understanding origins helps explain diversity

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Use this phrase to frame why church history matters: modern doctrines, denominations, and disputes come out of these earlier struggles.

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**  
> This is your roadmap for the course: every modern Christian practice or belief has historical roots we'll trace.

## [SECTION] The Life and Ministry of Jesus

---

## SLIDE 4

# The Life, Death, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ
*(ca. 4 BCE – 30 CE)*

- Primary sources: the four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John)  
- Birth around 4 BCE; death ca. 29–30 CE  
- Public ministry begins with baptism  
- Calls twelve disciples, later known as apostles  
- Travels through Judea teaching and performing miracles  

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Map of Jesus's ministry in 1st century Palestine]

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Remind students that the Gospels are theological narratives, not modern biographies. Historians reconstruct cautiously.

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**  
> Gospels = faith documents, not neutral history. They tell us what early Christians believed about Jesus.

---

## SLIDE 5

# Sermon on the Mount & Beatitudes

- "Blessed are…" statements (Matt 5:3–12)  
- Their character and privileges (vv. 3–12)  
- Their responsibilities as "salt" and "light" (vv. 13–16)  
- Counter-cultural values  
- "Kingdom ethics" – blueprint for Christian living  

[POPUP: Beatitudes Examples]
- Blessed are the poor in spirit
- Blessed are those who mourn
- Blessed are the meek
- Blessed are those who hunger for righteousness

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**  
> Beatitudes flip social values: the weak/poor are blessed, not the powerful/rich.

---

## SLIDE 6

# Matthew's Antitheses: The Higher Law

- "You have heard it said… but I say to you…"  
- Law reinterpreted from external behavior to inner motives  
- Fulfillment of the Law (Matt 5:17)  
- Call to higher moral and spiritual standard  

[GRID_COMPARISON:
Old Understanding | Jesus's Teaching
Don't murder | Don't even be angry
Don't commit adultery | Don't even lust
Eye for an eye | Turn the other cheek
Love your neighbor | Love your enemies]

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Show how ethical emphasis shifts inward (intention, motive) rather than just outward rule-keeping.

---

## SLIDE 7

# Teaching Methods

## Parables
- Jesus "did not speak to them without a parable" (Mark 4:34)  
- Greek root: "comparison," set side by side  
- Short narratives and metaphors that demand interpretation  

## The Command to Love
- Primary message centered on love (Matt 22:36–40)  
  - Love God (Deut 6:5)  
  - Love neighbor (Lev 19:18)  
- Radically new applications:  
  - Turn the other cheek (Matt 5:39)  
  - Love your enemies (Matt 5:44)  

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Have students interpret one short parable in groups to experience the "work" of interpretation. Contrast "love your enemies" with common honor/shame or retaliation ethics in antiquity.

---

## SLIDE 8

# [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## Check Your Understanding

1. **DISCUSSION_PROMPT:** How does Jesus's teaching in the Sermon on the Mount differ from traditional Jewish law? Give specific examples.

2. What does "Christ" mean, and why is this title significant?

3. **Think-Pair-Share:** Choose one parable you know. What makes it effective as a teaching tool?

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**  
> Key points to remember:
> - Jesus intensifies rather than abolishes Jewish law
> - "Christ" = "Messiah" = "Anointed One"
> - Parables force listeners to think and interpret

## [SECTION] Passion, Death, and Resurrection

---

## SLIDE 9

# The Passion and Resurrection

- Entry into Jerusalem at Passover → crisis point  
- Last Supper with disciples  
- Betrayal by Judas Iscariot  
- Arrest, trial, and suffering ("Passion")  
- Condemned before Pilate (Matt 27:1–2, 11–25)  
- Scourged and crucified (Matt 27:26–50)  
- Laid in tomb (Matt 27:57–60)  
- Resurrection (John 20:3–18)  

[WARNING_BOX: "Passion" = suffering, not emotion]

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Explain "Passion" = suffering. Use the sequence of Gospel texts as a narrative spine.

---

## SLIDE 10

# Christology: Who Is Jesus?

- Branch of Christian theology dealing with the person, nature, and role of Jesus Christ  

## Divine and Human Nature
- **Hypostatic Union:** Jesus fully divine and fully human  
- **Incarnation:** God becomes human in Jesus Christ  

[POPUP: Why This Matters]
- If Jesus is only human → can't save
- If Jesus is only divine → didn't really suffer
- Christian answer: both/and, not either/or

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Students don't need to master the terms, but they should grasp that early debates centered on *who* Jesus is.

---

## SLIDE 11

# Titles of Christ

- **Christ/Messiah** – "Anointed One"  
- **King of the Jews** – spiritual king with royal lineage  
- **Savior** – saves his people from their sins (Matt 1:21)  
  - Sin = willful disobedience of God's commandments  
  - Sin cuts humans off from God  
  - Savior needed to justify (pardon, clear from guilt)  
- **Son of God** – divine sonship central to Christianity  
- **"I AM"** – Johannine language linking Jesus to divine name

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Connect these titles to Jewish expectations (Messiah, Son of David) and how Christians universalize them.

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**  
> Each title tells us something about how early Christians understood Jesus's identity and mission.

---

## SLIDE 12

# Work of Jesus – Soteriology

- **Soteriology:** theology of salvation  
- Jesus identifies as Messiah (Luke 4:18–21; Mark 14:61–62)  
- **Atonement:** reconciliation of God and humanity through Christ  
- Passion (suffering and death)  
  - Gethsemane (Luke 22:44)  
  - Crucifixion  
  - Resurrection  

## Christus Victor
- Jesus' death and resurrection as victory over sin, death, and the devil  

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Briefly name that other atonement theories exist (penal substitution, moral influence, etc.) but don't go deep unless this is a theology class.

---

## [SECTION] From Jewish Sect to Universal Religion

---

## SLIDE 13

# From Jesus Movement to Universal Religion

- Early followers: Jewish "Jesus movement" inside Judaism  
- After resurrection, apostles commanded to teach Gentiles (Matt 28:19 vs. Matt 10:5–6)  
- Atonement extended to all who believe, repent, and are baptized  

[GRID_COMPARISON:
Before Resurrection | After Resurrection
Jewish disciples only | All nations
Jerusalem-centered | Spreading outward
Torah observance assumed | New covenant in Christ
Ethnic boundaries | Universal invitation]

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Stress the shift from intra-Jewish sect to Gentile-inclusive religion.

---

## SLIDE 14

# Earliest Church (ca. 33–90 CE)

- Emerges within Roman Empire  
- House churches, shared meals, local leadership  
- No formal hierarchy yet
- Persecution begins sporadically
- Oral tradition gradually written down

[IMG_PLACEHOLDER: Diagram of typical house church layout]

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Contrast flexibility of early house churches with later institution-building.

> **STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**  
> Early Christianity = small, informal, persecuted. Very different from later imperial church!

# [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]
## Synthesis Activities

1. **Timeline Creation:** Create a simple timeline of Jesus's life from birth to resurrection. Mark the key turning points.

2. **Concept Map:** Draw connections between these terms:
   - Messiah/Christ
   - Incarnation
   - Atonement
   - Salvation

3. **DISCUSSION_PROMPT:** How does Christianity maintain continuity with Judaism while also departing from it?

---

## SLIDE 16

# Ancient Period Begins (100–500 CE)

## Growth Despite Persecution
- Apostles die without formal succession plan  
- Christian communities spread across eastern Roman Empire  
- Local leadership emerges:  
  - **Episkopos** (overseer / bishop)  
  - **Presbyter** (elder)  
- No single authority yet for whole church  
- Growth provokes Roman suspicion, persecution, martyrdom  
- Persecutions fail to destroy movement  

> **SPEAKER NOTES:**  
> Introduce term "martyr" and how persecution shaped Christian identity.
