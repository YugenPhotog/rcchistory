<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Welcome to your study of world religions! This opening slide signals that we're about to embark on a three-day journey through Chapter 1. Think of it like building a house: before we can explore individual religious traditions (the rooms), we need to lay a solid foundation. Today's class establishes <em>how</em> we'll approach studying religion—the tools, lenses, and attitudes we'll bring to this work.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">What's Coming in Chapter 1</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Day 1 (today)</strong>: We focus on our <em>approach and assumptions</em>. You'll learn about worldview, preunderstanding, and "holy envy"—basically, how to study other people's beliefs respectfully and thoughtfully without losing your own perspective.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Day 2</strong>: We'll tackle the big question: What <em>is</em> religion? This involves looking at building blocks like myth, ritual, and the sacred.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Day 3</strong>: We examine <em>how</em> we study religion academically—the methods scholars use to understand religious traditions without judging them as true or false.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  You can't just jump into studying Buddhism or Islam without first understanding your own lens. Every person sees the world through a particular worldview shaped by their upbringing, culture, and experiences. This chapter helps you become <em>aware</em> of your lens so you can see other traditions more clearly. It's like cleaning your glasses before trying to read—you'll get a much sharper picture.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">🎬 Don't Forget!</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Check Canvas for the "Lens Repair 101" documentary assignment. This video is going to reinforce everything we cover about <em>how</em> to study religion respectfully and academically. Download the viewing guide worksheet before you watch—it'll help you track the key concepts and make sure you're ready for the quiz.

### SLIDE 2: What is "World Religions"?

## World Religions vs. Religions of the World

**We'll use the term [KEY_TERM]"World Religions"[/KEY_TERM] to mean:**

◆ Religions which have broken out of their country of origin and now have a global presence

◆ Examples: Buddhism (from India → Asia, West), Christianity (from Middle East → global), Islam (from Arabia → global)

[POPUP_TRIGGER id="world-religions-def"]"World Religions"[/POPUP_TRIGGER]

[POPUP id="world-religions-def"]
**World Religions**

Religions that have expanded beyond their region of origin and now have global presence. Examples include Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, and sometimes Sikhism, Bahá'í, and others.

Note: This is a pedagogical framework created in the 1960s, not a natural or timeless category.

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  This slide introduces a key organizing framework for the entire course: the concept of "world religions." You might think this is a simple, obvious category, but here's the twist—it's actually a constructed framework created by educators in the 1960s, not some timeless or natural way of dividing up human religious experience. Understanding <em>why</em> we use this framework and what its limitations are will help you think critically throughout the semester.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Breaking It Down</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>"World religions"</strong> refers to religious traditions that have <em>broken out</em> of their country or region of origin and now have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_religious_groups" target="_blank">global presence</a>. Think about it: Christianity started in the ancient Middle East but is now practiced on every continent. Buddhism began in India but spread throughout East and Southeast Asia and eventually to Europe and the Americas. Islam originated in the Arabian Peninsula but now has adherents from Indonesia to Morocco to the United States.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  These are <em>world</em> religions not because they're inherently "better" or more "advanced" than other traditions, but simply because they've spread globally through various historical processes—sometimes through peaceful missionary work, sometimes through colonialism and conquest, sometimes through migration and diaspora communities.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  By using "world religions" as our organizing principle, we're making a practical pedagogical choice: it helps structure a semester-long course and allows us to focus on traditions that have had widespread global impact. But you need to be aware that this framework is <em>constructed</em>—it's a tool for organizing knowledge, not an objective description of reality. The next slide will dig into why this matters and what the limitations of this framework are.

### SLIDE 3: A Note on This Framework

## ⚠️ Critical Awareness: The "Map is Not Territory"

The "world religions" approach was developed by British educators in the 1960s to broaden religious education beyond Christianity.

**While useful for organizing our study, scholars now recognize this framework has [KEY_TERM]limitations[/KEY_TERM]:**

◆ It can make religions look more unified and bounded than they really are

◆ It emphasizes beliefs and texts (a Protestant Christian model) over practices and diversity

◆ It marginalizes traditions that don't fit the "Big Five" mold (indigenous religions, "folk" practices, hybrid traditions)

[WARNING_BOX]
**Think of the "world religions" paradigm as a MAP** — useful for navigation, but remember: **the map is not the territory.**

We'll point out where the map oversimplifies as we go.
[/WARNING_BOX]

[POPUP_TRIGGER id="paradigm-critique"]World Religions Paradigm Critique[/POPUP_TRIGGER]

[POPUP id="paradigm-critique"]
**World Religions Paradigm (WRP)**

A framework developed in 1960s Britain for organizing religious studies education. Critics (Owen 2011, Cotter & Robertson 2016) note it:
- Models all religions on Protestant Christianity (emphasis on belief, texts, founders)
- Creates artificial boundaries between traditions
- Privileges certain traditions while marginalizing others
- Reflects colonial assumptions about "civilized" vs "primitive" religions

We use it pragmatically while remaining aware of its limitations.
[/POPUP]

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Here's where things get interesting: we're about to use a framework (world religions) while simultaneously critiquing it. This might feel contradictory, but it's actually a sophisticated scholarly move. Think of it like using a GPS to navigate—you find it useful for getting where you need to go, but you also recognize that the map on your screen simplifies reality and might not show you every alley or shortcut. We're going to use the "world religions" paradigm <em>pragmatically</em> while remaining critically aware of its shortcomings.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Breaking It Down</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>The 1960s British origin</strong>: The "world religions" approach emerged in Britain when educators wanted to broaden religious education beyond just Christianity. This was progressive for its time—it acknowledged religious diversity. But here's the catch: the framework was built by people coming from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism" target="_blank">Protestant Christian</a> background, and they unconsciously modeled it on their own tradition.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Making religions look unified</strong>: When we talk about "Hinduism" or "Buddhism," we risk making these traditions sound like single, coherent systems with clear boundaries. In reality, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism" target="_blank">Hinduism</a> is incredibly diverse—there's no single founder, no single sacred text, no unified set of beliefs. The label "Hinduism" itself is relatively modern and was largely imposed by outsiders. Similarly, Buddhism encompasses vastly different practices from Zen meditation in Japan to tantric rituals in Tibet.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Emphasizing beliefs and texts</strong>: Protestant Christianity historically emphasized <em>what you believe</em> (doctrine, creeds) over <em>what you do</em> (rituals, practices). When we study other religions through this lens, we unconsciously privilege beliefs and sacred texts, which might not be what practitioners themselves consider most important. Many traditions emphasize orthopraxy (right practice) over orthodoxy (right belief).
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Marginalizing some traditions</strong>: The "Big Five" or "Big Six" world religions framework tends to center Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and sometimes Judaism and Sikhism. But what about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_religion" target="_blank">indigenous religions</a>, African diasporic traditions like Vodou or Candomblé, or "folk" practices that blend multiple traditions? These get pushed to the margins or relegated to a catch-all category like "primal religions"—a problematic term that implies they're less developed.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  The warning box on this slide uses a perfect metaphor: <strong>the map is not the territory</strong>. This comes from philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski" target="_blank">Alfred Korzybski</a>, who reminded us that representations of reality are not the same as reality itself. A map of Illinois simplifies the actual landscape—it doesn't show every tree, every hill, every house. It's useful for navigation, but you wouldn't confuse the paper map for the actual place. Same thing here: "world religions" is a useful organizing map for our course, but it simplifies and distorts the actual diversity of human religious experience.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Throughout the semester, your professor will point out where the map oversimplifies. You'll learn to see the internal diversity <em>within</em> traditions and the blurred boundaries <em>between</em> them. This critical awareness is what separates sophisticated religious studies from simplistic stereotyping.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">🎓 Scholars Weigh In</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: 1em;">Christopher R. Cotter & David G. Robertson – <em>After World Religions</em> (2016)</h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Cotter and Robertson are part of a movement of scholars calling for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Religions_Paradigm" target="_blank">moving beyond the World Religions Paradigm</a>. They argue that the framework reflects colonial-era assumptions about what counts as a "real" or "civilized" religion. When European colonizers encountered indigenous traditions, they often dismissed them as "superstition" or "animism" rather than recognizing them as sophisticated religious systems. The world religions framework, even though well-intentioned, still carries some of that baggage—it privileges traditions that look like Christianity (with founders, scriptures, centralized institutions) and marginalizes traditions that don't fit that mold. For this course, we're using the framework because it's practical for a 15-week semester, but we're doing so with our eyes wide open to its limitations.

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  This is a transition slide marking the beginning of a new section. We're shifting from talking about the framework we'll use (world religions paradigm) to examining the <em>lenses</em> through which we see the world. Before you can fairly study other people's worldviews, you need to understand your own. Think of this as stepping back to examine the glasses you've been wearing your whole life—you might not even realize you're wearing them until someone asks you to look at them directly.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">What's Coming</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  In the next several slides, you'll learn about <strong>worldview</strong> (the comprehensive framework of beliefs and assumptions through which you interpret reality) and <strong>preunderstanding</strong> (the background knowledge and assumptions you bring to any new experience). These concepts are crucial because they determine how you'll receive and interpret everything you learn about Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, and other traditions this semester.

### SLIDE 6: What is a Worldview?

## Worldview = Your Lens on Reality

A [POPUP_TRIGGER id="worldview-def"]worldview[/POPUP_TRIGGER] is essentially a **lens** through which individuals interpret and interact with the world around them.

It encompasses a set of beliefs, values, and assumptions that shape how one understands reality and their place within it.

[POPUP id="worldview-def"]
**Worldview**

A comprehensive framework of beliefs, values, and assumptions through which an individual interprets all of reality. Includes views on:
- What exists (ontology)
- How we know (epistemology)  
- What's right/wrong (ethics)
- What it means to be human (anthropology)
- Origins and purpose (cosmology)

Everyone has a worldview, whether consciously articulated or not.

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  This slide introduces the concept of <strong>worldview</strong> using a powerful metaphor: the lens. Just as a camera lens or a pair of glasses shapes what you see and how you see it, your worldview shapes how you interpret <em>everything</em>—from what counts as "real" to what you consider morally right or wrong. Here's the crucial insight: <strong>everyone</strong> has a worldview, whether they've consciously articulated it or not. You can't <em>not</em> have a lens—you can only become more aware of what yours looks like.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Breaking It Down</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Worldview as a comprehensive framework</strong>: Your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldview" target="_blank">worldview</a> isn't just one or two beliefs—it's an entire interlocking system of assumptions, values, and convictions. It shapes how you answer big questions (What is real? How do we know things? What is good?) and small questions (How should I treat strangers? What does it mean to live a good life?).
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Shaped by culture, upbringing, experiences</strong>: Nobody is born with a worldview fully formed. You absorb it from your family, your community, your culture, your education, your personal experiences. If you grew up in a devoutly religious household, your worldview was shaped by that. If you grew up in a secular, scientifically-oriented household, your worldview was shaped by <em>that</em>. If you experienced trauma or profound joy, those experiences became part of your lens. None of this is neutral—your worldview reflects your particular location in history, geography, culture, and society.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>No one has a "neutral" or "objective" view</strong>: This is a critical point that students sometimes resist. You might think, "I'm open-minded" or "I just look at the facts." But here's the thing: <em>what counts as a fact</em> depends on your worldview. A scientist and a mystic might both witness the same sunset, but they'll interpret it through completely different frameworks. The scientist might see photons scattering through atmospheric particles. The mystic might see the divine presence manifest in nature. Neither perspective is "view from nowhere"—both are shaped by particular worldviews.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Understanding that you <em>have</em> a worldview—and that it's not neutral—is the first step toward studying other traditions fairly. If you're not aware of your lens, you'll unconsciously impose your assumptions onto everything you study. You might judge another tradition as "irrational" simply because it doesn't share your culture's assumptions about what counts as rational. Or you might romanticize a tradition by projecting your own values onto it. Awareness of your worldview creates the space for genuine understanding of others' worldviews.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">🎓 Scholars Weigh In</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: 1em;">James W. Sire – <em>The Universe Next Door</em></h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Sire is a Christian philosopher who has done extensive work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldview" target="_blank">worldview analysis</a>. His key insight is that worldviews function like "mental maps" that guide our navigation through life. He argues that most people's worldviews are largely <em>unconscious</em>—they operate in the background, shaping our perceptions and judgments without us realizing it. Sire's approach is useful for this course because he provides a set of questions that <em>any</em> worldview answers, whether religious, secular, materialist, or spiritual. These are the "seven basic questions" you'll see on the next slide. By asking these questions of different worldviews, you can understand them on their own terms rather than judging them by your own standards.

### SLIDE 7: The Seven Basic Questions

## Every Worldview Answers These Questions:

1. **What is ultimate reality?**  
   *(Some traditions answer with concepts of God or gods, others with sacred powers or cosmic principles, others with emptiness or interconnection)*

2. What is the origin and nature of the universe?

3. What is the origin and nature of **humanity**?

4. Does human life have a purpose?

5. How do **humans** acquire knowledge?

6. What is the basis of ethics and morality?

7. What happens to **humans** after death?

**Over the semester, we will see how various people have historically answered these questions!**

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**
<aside class="notes">
<div style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Every worldview—whether religious, secular, philosophical, or scientific—provides answers to these seven fundamental questions. Notice how the first question has been carefully revised: it asks about "ultimate reality" rather than assuming God or gods. This inclusive phrasing allows for traditions that answer with non-theistic concepts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman" target="_blank">Brahman</a> (Hinduism), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81" target="_blank">Śūnyatā/emptiness</a> (Buddhism), or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dao" target="_blank">Dao</a> (Daoism).
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Breaking It Down</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Question 1</strong> (What is ultimate reality?): A Christian might answer "God"; a Buddhist might answer "emptiness and interdependence"; a scientific materialist might answer "matter and energy governed by natural laws." Notice these aren't just different opinions—they fundamentally shape how people experience reality itself.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Questions 2-4</strong> (Origins, human nature, purpose): These questions map onto what philosophers call <strong>cosmology</strong> (where everything came from) and <strong>anthropology</strong> (what it means to be human). A Hindu might say humans are on a journey through cycles of rebirth toward liberation; an existentialist might say we create our own purpose in an otherwise meaningless universe.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Question 5</strong> (How do humans acquire knowledge?): This is <strong>epistemology</strong>—the study of knowledge itself. Does truth come from scripture, reason, empirical observation, mystical experience, or some combination? Different traditions prioritize different sources.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Questions 6-7</strong> (Ethics and afterlife): These shape how people live day-to-day. If you believe in karma and rebirth, your ethical reasoning will differ from someone who believes in one life followed by eternal judgment, which will differ from someone who believes death is simply the end.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Over the semester, you'll see how different traditions answer these questions. But here's the key insight: <strong>your own answers to these questions shape how you'll initially perceive other traditions</strong>. If you're a scientific materialist, you might struggle to understand mystical experiences. If you're deeply religious, you might find secular worldviews puzzling or incomplete. Recognizing your own answers is the first step toward understanding why others answer differently.

### SLIDE 8: Preunderstanding

## Coming to Grips with Your Preunderstanding

[POPUP_TRIGGER id="preunderstanding-def"]**Preunderstanding**[/POPUP_TRIGGER] = the understanding of reality with which one makes sense of new experiences

◆ It's the background assumptions (correct or not) that shape how we interpret new texts, experiences, and ideas

◆ **Everyone** has preunderstandings—they come from our upbringing, culture, education, personal experiences

◆ **Important:** Preunderstanding *changes over time* as we learn and grow

[POPUP id="preunderstanding-def"]
**Preunderstanding**

The set of assumptions, beliefs, and frameworks you bring to any new learning experience. Includes:
- Cultural background
- Religious upbringing (or lack thereof)
- Media representations
- Family attitudes
- Previous education

Preunderstanding is unavoidable but can be examined and revised through education.
[/POPUP]

**Why Does This Matter for Studying Religion?**

If you don't recognize your own preunderstandings, you'll unconsciously judge other traditions by the standards of your own background.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**
<aside class="notes">
<div style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Preunderstanding</strong> is your starting point—the set of assumptions you bring to any new learning experience before you've even begun. It's unavoidable and not inherently bad, but it's crucial to recognize it because it shapes how you interpret everything you encounter. Think of it like wearing glasses: you can't see <em>without</em> them, but you need to know you're wearing them or you'll think everyone else sees the world exactly as you do.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Breaking It Down</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Background assumptions</strong>: Your preunderstanding comes from your upbringing, culture, education, media exposure, and personal experiences. If you grew up Christian, you might unconsciously assume "religion" means having a personal relationship with God, attending weekly services, and believing certain doctrines. But when we study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism" target="_blank">Buddhism</a>, those assumptions won't fit—many Buddhists focus on practice over belief and don't worship a personal God.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Everyone has preunderstandings</strong>: This isn't about being biased or wrong—it's about being human. Even scholars who've studied religion for decades have preunderstandings shaped by their particular training and perspectives. The difference is that good scholars are <em>aware</em> of their preunderstandings and actively work to bracket them.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Preunderstanding changes</strong>: Here's the good news—your preunderstanding isn't fixed. As you learn about different traditions this semester, your assumptions will shift. You might discover that some of your initial ideas were based on stereotypes or incomplete information. That's exactly what education is supposed to do.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  If you don't recognize your own preunderstandings, you'll unconsciously judge other traditions by the standards of your own background. You might think "Buddhism is weird because it doesn't have a God" without realizing that your assumption that religion <em>requires</em> God is itself culturally specific. Recognizing preunderstanding is the key to studying other traditions on their own terms rather than imposing your framework onto them.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">🎓 Scholars Weigh In</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: 1em;">Hans-Georg Gadamer – <em>Truth and Method</em></h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  German philosopher Gadamer (1900-2002) developed the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics" target="_blank">philosophical hermeneutics</a>, which emphasizes that all understanding begins with preunderstanding. He argued that rather than trying to eliminate our assumptions (which is impossible), we should bring them into dialogue with the text or tradition we're studying. This creates a "fusion of horizons" where our understanding evolves through encounter with difference.

### SLIDE 9: Reflection Activity

## Recognizing Your Own Preunderstanding

**Take 2 minutes to reflect silently:**

1. What religious or spiritual tradition (if any) did you grow up with?

2. What assumptions about "religion" might come from that background?

3. What have you heard (from family, media, friends) about traditions different from your own?

*You don't need to share—this is for your own awareness.*

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  This reflection activity asks you to get specific about your own preunderstanding. Rather than staying abstract, actually identify concrete assumptions you might be bringing to the study of world religions. This is personal work—you're not required to share it with anyone, but doing it honestly will significantly improve your learning this semester.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Here's what makes this exercise valuable: by naming your assumptions explicitly, you're taking the first step toward being able to temporarily set them aside when studying other traditions. If you grew up hearing that "Hinduism worships many gods and that's wrong," you can recognize that as a preunderstanding shaped by monotheistic assumptions and Christian family influence—not as objective truth. Then when we study Hinduism, you can ask "What does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytheism" target="_blank">multiplicity of divine forms</a> mean to practitioners?" instead of immediately judging it by your own theological standards. Throughout the semester, keep checking in with yourself: "Am I judging this tradition by the standards of my own background? Or am I trying to understand it on its own terms?"

### SLIDE 10: Holy Envy [ASSESSMENT_BREAK]

# Holy Envy
Our Class Posture

[DISCUSSION_PROMPT]
Before we continue, turn to a neighbor: Share one thing about your own background or tradition that you'd want others to approach with appreciation rather than criticism. (2 minutes)
[/DISCUSSION_PROMPT]

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**
<aside class="notes">
<div style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  This discussion prompt helps you practice the posture we'll take all semester. Before learning about "holy envy" as an abstract concept, you're experiencing it concretely: thinking about how <em>you</em> would want your own background or tradition approached by others. Would you want people to lead with criticism or with appreciation? To look for what's weird or what's meaningful? This personal reflection makes it easier to extend the same courtesy to traditions you'll study.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  The Golden Rule applies to religious studies: approach other traditions the way you'd want yours approached. If you grew up Catholic and someone studied Catholicism only by reading about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases" target="_blank">abuse scandals</a> without understanding the beauty of the liturgy, the depth of social teaching, or the lived experience of devoted practitioners, you'd rightfully say they're missing the point. Similarly, studying Islam only through terrorism, or Buddhism only through Western appropriation, gives a distorted picture. Holy envy means beginning with appreciation—looking for what's beautiful, profound, and meaningful—<em>before</em> moving to critical analysis.

### SLIDE 11: Krister Stendahl's Approach

## [POPUP_TRIGGER id="holy-envy-def"]Holy Envy[/POPUP_TRIGGER]: A Posture of Appreciative Learning

Rather than dismissing or attacking what we don't understand, we approach other traditions with **curiosity and respect**—even "envying" (admiring) what's beautiful or profound in them.

[POPUP id="holy-envy-def"]
**Holy Envy**

A term coined by Swedish Lutheran bishop and scholar Krister Stendahl (1921-2008). It describes an approach to interfaith study where you:
- Appreciate what's admirable in other traditions
- Learn from their insights and practices
- Remain open to being enriched by difference

Without necessarily converting or abandoning your own commitments.
[/POPUP]

**[POPUP_TRIGGER id="stendahl"]Krister Stendahl's[/POPUP_TRIGGER] Three Rules:**

1. **Compare best with best** (not your best with their worst)

2. **Compare only equals** (insiders with insiders, outsiders with outsiders)

3. **Leave room for "holy envy"** (find something to appreciate)

[POPUP id="stendahl"]
**Krister Stendahl (1921-2008)**

Swedish Lutheran bishop, New Testament scholar, and Harvard Divinity School dean. Pioneer in Jewish-Christian dialogue. Developed "holy envy" concept to promote respectful interfaith learning.

His approach emphasizes letting each tradition define itself rather than imposing outsider categories.

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Holy envy</strong> is the core posture we'll take all semester. Rather than approaching other traditions with suspicion, dismissal, or the goal of debunking them, we approach with curiosity, respect, and even admiration for what's beautiful or profound. The term was coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krister_Stendahl" target="_blank">Krister Stendahl</a>, a Swedish Lutheran bishop and Harvard scholar who pioneered Jewish-Christian dialogue in the mid-20th century.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Breaking It Down</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Rule 1 - Compare best with best</strong>: Don't compare the ideal version of your own tradition with the worst examples of another. If you're Christian, don't compare Jesus's Sermon on the Mount with ISIS beheadings and conclude Christianity is superior. That's intellectually dishonest. Compare ideals with ideals, or real-world practices with real-world practices.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Rule 2 - Compare equals</strong>: Compare insider accounts with insider accounts, or outsider analyses with outsider analyses. Don't compare what you as an insider believe about your tradition with what a hostile critic says about another tradition. Let practitioners speak for themselves.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Rule 3 - Leave room for holy envy</strong>: Find something to genuinely appreciate in each tradition. This doesn't mean you have to convert or abandon your own commitments. A Christian can appreciate Buddhist meditation practices. An atheist can admire Islamic architecture. A Hindu can respect Jewish ethical emphasis on justice. The point is to approach with generosity rather than defensiveness.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Holy envy creates the intellectual and emotional conditions for genuine learning. When you're defensive or looking to prove your own tradition superior, you can't really <em>hear</em> what another tradition is saying. But when you approach with openness—ready to be enriched rather than threatened—you can understand traditions on their own terms. This doesn't compromise your ability to think critically; it actually enables better criticism because you're engaging with what people actually believe and practice, not with caricatures.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">🎓 Scholars Weigh In</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: 1em;">Krister Stendahl – <em>Harvard Divinity School</em></h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Stendahl developed these principles through decades of Jewish-Christian dialogue. As a Lutheran bishop and New Testament scholar, he maintained his Christian commitments while developing deep appreciation for Judaism. His approach influenced a generation of scholars to move beyond apologetics (defending your own tradition) and polemics (attacking others) toward genuine interfaith understanding. His work demonstrates that respect for other traditions doesn't require relativism or abandoning truth claims—it requires intellectual honesty and human decency.

### SLIDE 12: Labels and Categories

## A Note on Labels

**Many religious labels we use were created by [KEY_TERM]outsiders[/KEY_TERM] (often Western scholars or colonizers), not by the practitioners themselves:**

◆ **"Hinduism"** — British colonial term. Many practitioners use *Sanatana Dharma* or identify by specific tradition ([POPUP_TRIGGER id="shaiva"]Shaiva[/POPUP_TRIGGER], [POPUP_TRIGGER id="vaishnava"]Vaishnava[/POPUP_TRIGGER])

◆ **"Buddhism"** — Western term. Practitioners might say *Buddhadharma* or focus on their lineage (Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana)

◆ **"Shinto"** — Created in modern period to distinguish "native" Japanese practices from Buddhism

[POPUP id="shaiva"]
**Shaiva**

Devotees of Shiva, one of Hinduism's major deities. Shaivism emphasizes asceticism, meditation, and philosophical inquiry. Includes traditions like Kashmir Shaivism and devotional bhakti movements.
[/POPUP]

[POPUP id="vaishnava"]
**Vaishnava**

Devotees of Vishnu and his avatars (especially Krishna and Rama). Vaishnavism emphasizes devotion (bhakti), scripture study, and ethical living. Largest Hindu denomination globally.
[/POPUP]

**Why does this matter?**

Labels shape how we understand traditions. Outsider categories can obscure internal diversity. Be aware: when we say "Hinduism," we're using a shorthand that may not match how practitioners describe themselves.

**We'll point out these tensions as we go.**

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**
<aside class="notes">
<div style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  This slide introduces a critical awareness that will recur throughout the semester: many of the labels we use for religious traditions were created by <strong>outsiders</strong>—often Western scholars, missionaries, or colonial administrators—not by the practitioners themselves. This matters because labels aren't neutral; they shape how we understand and categorize traditions.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Breaking It Down</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>"Hinduism"</strong> is a perfect example. British colonial officials needed a category for the diverse religious practices they encountered in India, so they created the umbrella term "Hinduism." But many practitioners don't use this label. They might identify with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanatan_Dharma" target="_blank">Sanatana Dharma</a> (eternal law/truth) or specify their particular tradition—Shaiva (devotees of Shiva), Vaishnava (devotees of Vishnu), Shakta (devotees of the Goddess), and so on.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>"Buddhism"</strong> is similar—it's a Western term. Many practitioners would say <em>Buddhadharma</em> (the teachings of the Buddha) or identify primarily with their specific lineage: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada" target="_blank">Theravada</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana" target="_blank">Mahayana</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajrayana" target="_blank">Vajrayana</a>. The umbrella term smooths over enormous theological and practical differences.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>"Shinto"</strong> was created in the modern period (late 19th century) to distinguish "native" Japanese practices from Buddhism, which had come from China and Korea. Before that, there wasn't a single term for what we now call Shinto—people just practiced their local traditions.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  When we use these outsider labels, we're imposing categories that may obscure how practitioners actually understand themselves. "Hinduism" makes the tradition look more unified than it is; "Buddhism" might mask regional and sectarian diversity. Throughout the semester, we'll use these labels pragmatically (they're the common academic terms), but we'll also note their limitations and point out insider terminology when relevant. Think of it this way: the labels are like a map's borders—useful for orientation, but they don't always match how people on the ground experience their territory.

  Religious studies scholar Jonathan Z. Smith (1938-2017) famously argued that "religion" itself is not a natural category but a scholarly construct. His work emphasizes that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_religions" target="_blank">religious classifications</a> always reflect the interests and perspectives of those doing the classifying. This doesn't mean the categories are useless, but it means we must use them critically, always aware of whose perspectives they privilege and whose they marginalize.

### SLIDE 13: Practice vs. Belief

## An Important Distinction: What You DO vs. What You BELIEVE

Western education often emphasizes what people **believe** (doctrines, creeds, theological ideas).

But for many traditions, what matters most is what you **[KEY_TERM]do[/KEY_TERM]**—ritual, ethics, community participation.

**Examples:**

◆ **Orthodox Judaism:** Emphasizes [POPUP_TRIGGER id="halakha"]halakha[/POPUP_TRIGGER] (Jewish law/practice) over specific theological beliefs

◆ **Confucianism:** Focuses on ritual propriety ([POPUP_TRIGGER id="li"]li[/POPUP_TRIGGER]) and ethical relationships

◆ **Many Indigenous traditions:** Emphasize maintaining right relationships with land, ancestors, spirits through practice

[POPUP id="halakha"]
**Halakha (הֲלָכָה)**

Jewish law derived from Torah, Talmud, and rabbinic interpretation. Governs daily life including diet (kashrut), Sabbath observance, prayer, marriage, and business ethics. Literally means "the way to walk."
[/POPUP]

[POPUP id="li"]
**Li (禮)**

Chinese concept meaning ritual propriety, etiquette, or ceremony. In Confucianism, li shapes social harmony through correct performance of roles and relationships. Includes everything from state ceremonies to everyday manners.
[/POPUP]

**This doesn't mean beliefs don't matter**—but don't assume every tradition prioritizes belief the way Protestant Christianity does.

**STUDY BUDDY NOTES:**
<aside class="notes">
<div style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  This distinction is absolutely critical for avoiding one of the most common mistakes in studying religion: assuming every tradition works the way <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism" target="_blank">Protestant Christianity</a> works. In Protestant Christianity (especially evangelical varieties), the emphasis is often on what you believe—your personal faith in Jesus, your acceptance of certain doctrines. But many traditions don't operate this way at all.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Breaking It Down</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Orthodox Judaism</strong> emphasizes <em>halakha</em>—the way you walk, meaning Jewish law and practice. An Orthodox Jew who observes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat" target="_blank">Shabbat</a>, keeps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashrut" target="_blank">kosher</a>, prays daily, and follows rabbinic law is considered authentically Jewish even if they have doubts about God's existence. Meanwhile, someone who "believes in God" but doesn't practice might be seen as less authentically Jewish. This is the opposite priority from Protestant Christianity.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Confucianism</strong> focuses on <em>li</em> (ritual propriety) and ethical relationships. The question isn't "Do you believe Confucius was divinely inspired?" but rather "Do you practice filial piety? Do you cultivate virtue through ritual? Do you maintain proper relationships?" Confucianism is fundamentally about <em>orthopraxy</em> (right practice) rather than <em>orthodoxy</em> (right belief).
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Indigenous traditions</strong> often emphasize maintaining right relationships with land, ancestors, and spirits through ritual and ceremony. The focus is on reciprocity, respect, and balance—lived practice rather than abstract theological propositions. You might ask "Does this person participate in ceremonies? Do they honor the ancestors?" not "What exactly do they believe about the spirit world?"
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Many American students—even non-religious ones—have absorbed Protestant cultural assumptions about what religion <em>is</em>. You might unconsciously think: "Religion is about what you believe in your heart." But this Protestant model doesn't describe how most religious traditions work historically or globally. When studying other traditions, always ask: "Does this tradition emphasize belief, practice, or both? What are the markers of authentic belonging?" Don't assume belief is always primary.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">🎓 Scholars Weigh In</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: 1em;">Talal Asad – <em>Genealogies of Religion</em></h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Anthropologist Talal Asad argues that the modern Western concept of "religion" as primarily about private belief is itself a product of Protestant Christianity and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism" target="_blank">Enlightenment secularism</a>. He shows how this definition marginalizes traditions where religion is about practice, community, and embodied knowledge rather than interior faith states. His work helps us recognize when we're unconsciously using Protestant assumptions to study non-Protestant (or non-Christian) traditions.

### SLIDE 14: Academic Study

## Theology vs. Religious Studies

[GRID_COMPARISON]
**LEFT COLUMN:**
### Theology = Faith seeking understanding

◆ Operates *from within* a religious tradition

◆ Asks: "What is true? How should we live according to our faith?"

◆ Seeks to clarify, defend, or interpret religious teachings

◆ **Example:** A Christian theologian exploring the Trinity

**RIGHT COLUMN:**
### Religious Studies = Academic study of religion

◆ Operates *from outside* ([POPUP_TRIGGER id="methodological-neutrality"]methodological neutrality[/POPUP_TRIGGER])

◆ Asks: "What do people believe? How do they practice? What does this mean to them?"

◆ Seeks to *understand and describe*, not to prove or disprove

◆ **Example:** A scholar analyzing how different Christian groups understand the Trinity
[/GRID_COMPARISON]

[POPUP id="methodological-neutrality"]
**Methodological Neutrality**

An academic approach that brackets questions of truth/falsehood to focus on describing and analyzing religion. Scholars don't ask "Is this true?" but rather "What does this mean to practitioners? How does it function?"

This is NOT the same as personal neutrality—scholars can have religious commitments, but in academic work they employ neutral methods.
[/POPUP]

**In this class, we do Religious Studies, not theology.**

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  This distinction between <strong>theology</strong> and <strong>religious studies</strong> defines what kind of course this is. We're doing religious studies, not theology. Understanding the difference is essential for navigating the semester successfully.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Breaking It Down</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Theology</strong> is "faith seeking understanding" (St. Anselm's famous definition). It operates from <em>within</em> a religious tradition and asks questions like "What is true? How should we live according to our faith? How do we interpret this scripture?" A Christian theologian exploring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity" target="_blank">Trinity</a> is working as an insider, using Christian scripture and tradition to understand Christian doctrine.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Religious studies</strong> operates from <em>outside</em> any particular tradition, using what's called <strong>methodological neutrality</strong>. This doesn't mean scholars are personally neutral or don't have religious commitments—many religious studies scholars are practicing believers. But in their <em>academic work</em>, they bracket questions of truth/falsehood and instead ask: "What do people believe? How do they practice? What does this mean to them? How does it function in their lives and societies?"
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Example comparison</strong>: A theologian asks "What is the true nature of the Trinity?" (insider question seeking theological truth). A religious studies scholar asks "How do different Christian groups—Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant—understand the Trinity differently? What historical and cultural factors shaped these different understandings?" (outsider questions seeking descriptive understanding).
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  This class isn't about changing your beliefs or converting you to anything. You're welcome to be religious, non-religious, or anything in between. What matters is that you can temporarily adopt the stance of methodological neutrality—describing and analyzing traditions on their own terms without constantly judging them by your own standards. Can a believer do this? Absolutely. Many scholars "code-switch" between insider theological thinking (in their personal lives or faith communities) and outsider analytical thinking (in academic work). The key is keeping these modes distinct.

  British religious studies scholar Ninian Smart (1927-2001) championed the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_of_religion" target="_blank">phenomenological</a> description in studying religion—trying to understand how believers themselves experience and understand their traditions before imposing theoretical frameworks. His approach emphasizes "bracketing" (temporarily setting aside) your own judgments to see traditions from practitioners' perspectives. This doesn't mean abandoning critical thinking; it means descriptive accuracy comes before theoretical explanation.

### SLIDE 15: Our Methodological Approach

## Methodological Neutrality in Practice

**In Religious Studies, we don't ask if beliefs are true or false. Instead, we:**

1. **Understand** what beliefs and practices mean to practitioners

2. **Describe** religions in their own terms

3. **Analyze** how religions function in individuals' lives and societies

**This is different from:**

❌ **Theology** (which operates from within a tradition)

❌ **Anti-religious polemics** (which seek to disprove or attack religion)

✅ **We're scholars, not evangelists or debunkers.**

**Describe Before Explain:**

◆ First, carefully observe and describe what people do and believe *in their own terms*

◆ Then, analyze or explain using theoretical frameworks

◆ Think of yourself as an anthropologist or journalist first, theorist second

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  This slide makes the methodological approach concrete and practical. In religious studies, we're neither evangelists (promoting religion) nor debunkers (attacking religion). We're scholars trying to understand how religion works in human life and culture. The "describe before explain" principle is key: start by carefully observing what people actually do and believe, <em>then</em> move to theoretical analysis.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Breaking It Down</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Understand what beliefs mean to practitioners</strong>: When studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma" target="_blank">karma</a> in Hinduism or Buddhism, don't immediately dismiss it as "superstition" or embrace it as "truth." Instead, ask: What does karma mean to practitioners? How does belief in karma shape ethical behavior? What comfort or motivation does it provide? What problems does it solve or create?
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Describe in their own terms</strong>: Let practitioners define their own traditions. Don't say "Muslims believe in a violent God" based on selective reading of the Qur'an. Look at how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim" target="_blank">Muslims</a> themselves describe Allah's attributes—justice, mercy, compassion. Use insider language and categories when possible.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Analyze function</strong>: How do beliefs and practices work in people's lives? What social functions do they serve? What psychological needs do they address? You can analyze without judging. For instance, you can study how prayer functions to create community solidarity without asking "Do prayers get answered?"
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Students sometimes worry: "But what if something is wrong or harmful?" Valid question. Here's the key: you can critique ideas while respecting people. Academic study means engaging critically but fairly. We can analyze power dynamics, contradictions, and ethical concerns without dismissing entire traditions wholesale. For example, we can study how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy" target="_blank">patriarchal structures</a> function in various religions—describing the theological justifications, analyzing the impacts on women's lives, examining resistance movements—without saying "Religion X is evil." We describe structures, analyze impacts, and let evidence guide conclusions.

His approach treats religions as "webs of significance" that people spin for themselves, requiring patient, detailed observation to understand. Think of yourself as an anthropologist first (describing carefully) and theorist second (explaining patterns).

### SLIDE 16: Day 1 Summary

## What We Covered Today

✅ The "world religions" framework—useful but constructed (map ≠ territory)

✅ Worldview—the lens through which we see reality

✅ Preunderstanding—recognizing our assumptions

✅ Holy envy—appreciative, respectful approach

✅ Insider/outsider labels—categories are constructed

✅ Practice vs. belief—not all traditions emphasize the same things

✅ Academic study vs. theology—we describe, not prescribe

**Next Class: Defining Religion**

We'll dive into:
◆ Building blocks: myth, ritual, sacred/ultimate, numinous
◆ Classic definitions from major theorists
◆ Why defining religion is so difficult

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  This summary slide recaps the essential conceptual tools you've gained in Day 1. These aren't just abstract ideas—they're practical frameworks you'll use throughout the semester every time you encounter a new tradition or concept.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Take a moment to internalize these core principles: The world religions framework is useful but constructed (the map is not the territory). Your worldview shapes what you see. Preunderstanding is unavoidable but can be examined. Holy envy means appreciating before critiquing. Insider/outsider labels matter. Practice and belief aren't the same thing. Academic study describes rather than prescribes. These principles will help you avoid common pitfalls—imposing your assumptions on others, judging traditions by inappropriate standards, mistaking categories for reality—and will enable more sophisticated, nuanced understanding of religious diversity.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Next class, we'll tackle an even more fundamental question: What <em>is</em> religion? How do we define it? What are its building blocks? Get ready to discover that defining "religion" is far more complicated—and interesting—than you might expect.
