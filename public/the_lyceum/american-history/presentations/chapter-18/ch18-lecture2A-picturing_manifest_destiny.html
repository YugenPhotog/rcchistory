                <h2>Part III: Daguerreotypes of Native Leaders</h2>
                <p>Photography's "Truth"</p>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <h3>Section Introduction (1 minute)</h3>
                    <p>Now we enter the world of early photography. The daguerreotype—popular in the 1840s and 1850s—was widely believed to be an unfiltered truth machine. "The camera cannot lie," people said. Of course, the camera lies all the time.</p>
                    <p>Think about daguerreotypes of Native diplomats and political leaders made in Washington, D.C. The subjects sit stiffly, often wearing clothing chosen not by themselves but by the studio. The background is a curtain; the context is removed. A chief who is in town negotiating a treaty is shown instead as an anonymous figure of "Indianness," timeless and abstract.</p>
                    <p>Photography becomes a paradox: it feels factual, but it erases history. No hint of the debates happening in Congress, no glimpse of Native newspapers, no sign of the complex political strategies unfolding across the Great Plains and the Southwest. The photograph freezes a person in a moment that implies permanence.</p>

                    <li><strong>The reality:</strong> The camera lies all the time</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Subjects sat stiffly in clothing often chosen by the studio, not themselves</li>
                            <li>Backgrounds were curtains—context removed</li>
                            <li>Chiefs negotiating treaties shown as anonymous figures of "Indianness"—timeless and abstract</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>What's missing:</strong> No hint of Congressional debates, Native newspapers, or complex political strategies unfolding across the Great Plains and Southwest</li>
                    <li><strong>The paradox:</strong> Photography feels factual, but it erases history. The photograph freezes a person in a moment that implies permanence—stripping away politics and modernity</li>
                    <li><strong>The pattern emerging:</strong> Landscapes with no Native presence + portraits suggesting an older world + photographs stripping away politics = a systematic erasure</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>By this point, students have three sets of images: landscapes with no Native presence, portraits that suggest an older world, photographs that strip away politics and modernity. The repetition builds pressure. They're already solving the puzzle.</p>

                <h2>Photography's Cultural Power</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>By the 1860s-1870s:</strong> Photographers like Mathew Brady, Southworth & Hawes, and Timothy O'Sullivan taught Americans that photographs were windows onto reality</li>
                    <li><strong>The shift:</strong> Photographs became data, evidence, proof</li>
                    <li><strong>The belief:</strong> What the camera framed became what people believed</li>
                    <li><strong>The impact:</strong> This conviction—which we still carry today—made photographic portrayals of the West immensely influential</li>
                    <li><strong>Setting the stage:</strong> With this power established, images could shape not just perception, but policy and action</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Before we move to Curtis, we need one more tool on the table: photography's cultural power. By the 1860s and 1870s, Brady, Southworth & Hawes, and Timothy O'Sullivan had taught Americans that photographs were windows onto reality. Photographs became data, evidence, proof.</p>
                    <p>That belief—which we still carry today—made the photographic portrayal of the West immensely influential. What the camera framed became what people believed. This set the stage for Curtis's enormous cultural impact.</p>

                <h2>Photography's "Objective" Lie</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The myth of "mechanical truth":</strong> Photography was believed to capture reality without bias or interpretation</li>
                    <li><strong>The reality:</strong> Every photograph involves choices
                        <ul>
                            <li>Photographer chooses framing</li>
                            <li>Photographer chooses timing</li>
                            <li>Photographer chooses subjects</li>
                            <li>Photographer chooses what to include—and what to exclude</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The danger:</strong> Photography claimed authority without accountability—people believed they were seeing "truth" when they were actually seeing the photographer's vision</li>
                    <li><strong>The impact on the West:</strong> Photographic "evidence" of Indigenous peoples as timeless, disappearing figures became accepted as fact rather than interpretation</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is crucial: the belief in photographic objectivity made photographic lies more powerful than painted ones. When Catlin painted romantic portraits, viewers understood those were artistic interpretations. But when photographers created the same romantic, decontextualized images, viewers believed they were seeing unmediated truth.</p>
                    <p>Every photograph is an argument. Every photograph reflects the photographer's choices about what to show and what to hide. But the medium's claim to mechanical objectivity disguises those choices.</p>

                    <p>Time to introduce new characters: white settlers. Bingham's "Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers," Ranney's trail scenes, Christensen's homesteading idylls. These images transform the West into a stage where the main actors are determined families, rugged individuals, and wagon trains rolling calmly toward the horizon.</p>
                    <p>Look carefully at what these scenes communicate: The land welcomes them. The atmosphere feels ordained. There is almost never a sense of conflict.

                    <p>Now we stop withholding. Curtis enters around 1890–1910 and gathers the visual habits Americans had absorbed over seventy years. He stages scenes using older clothing, removes signs of modern life, edits out clocks, wagons, fences, sewing machines, and metal tools. He even retouches photographs to erase evidence of Native modernity.</p>
                    <p>Then he names his most famous image "The Vanishing Race."</p>
                    <p>This is the moment when students realize: Everything they've been noticing had a cultural destination. The earlier landscapes, portraits, and daguerreotypes weren't random. They prepared Americans to believe that Indigenous peoples were fading away, relics of premodern time. Curtis did not invent this idea; he crystallized it, aestheticized it, and marketed it in twenty volumes.</p>

                            <li>Shaping pan-tribal movements</li>
