        <h1>Understanding Manifest Destiny as Discourse</h1>
        
        <p class="section-intro">How do we understand the power of ideas like Manifest Destiny? Not just as beliefs people held, but as systems of knowledge that shaped what seemed true, natural, and inevitable. To grasp this, we need to understand <strong>discourse</strong> as an analytical tool.</p>

        <h2>What is Discourse?</h2>
        
        <p>When historians talk about "discourse," we mean something more complex than just talk or conversation. A discourse is a <strong>system of knowledge-production</strong> that determines what can be said, thought, and known about a subject at a particular historical moment. It's not just ideas floating in the air—discourse has real power because it shapes how people understand reality itself.</p>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>Key Features of Discourse:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creates categories of knowledge</strong> - It establishes what counts as true, scientific, moral, or civilized</li>
                <li><strong>Produces subject positions</strong> - It defines who people are: civilized/savage, progressive/backward, destined/doomed</li>
                <li><strong>Naturalizes power relations</strong> - It makes inequality, violence, or domination appear inevitable or divinely ordained</li>
                <li><strong>Operates through multiple channels</strong> - Not just political speeches, but also science, art, religion, law, and everyday practice</li>
                <li><strong>Has material effects</strong> - Discourse doesn't just reflect reality; it creates reality through policies, institutions, and physical transformation of landscapes</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Think of discourse as an invisible architecture that organizes how a society sees the world. Once you recognize the architecture, you start seeing how it shows up everywhere—in paintings, photographs, laws, sermons, scientific reports, and popular culture.</p>

        <h2>Manifest Destiny as Discourse</h2>
        
        <p>Manifest Destiny—the belief that American expansion across the continent was inevitable, righteous, and divinely ordained—functioned as one of the most powerful discourses in 19th-century America. It wasn't invented out of thin air in the 1840s when John O'Sullivan coined the phrase. Rather, it crystallized older ideas (Puritan "errand into the wilderness," republican empire, racial hierarchy) into a coherent system that made continental expansion feel self-evident to white Americans.</p>
        
        <div class="pull-quote">
            "Manifest Destiny didn't just justify expansion—it made expansion unthinkable <em>not</em> to pursue."
        </div>
        
        <p>As a discourse, Manifest Destiny accomplished several things simultaneously:</p>
        
        <p><strong>It naturalized violence.</strong> By framing expansion as destiny, Americans could understand dispossession of Indigenous peoples and war with Mexico not as political choices but as inevitable historical processes. The violence wasn't something Americans <em>did</em>; it was something that <em>happened</em> as part of progress marching forward.</p>
        
        <p><strong>It organized knowledge production.</strong> Geographic surveys mapped the West in ways that emphasized resources awaiting development. Ethnographic studies catalogued Indigenous peoples as specimens of "vanishing" races. Travel narratives depicted landscapes as empty or underutilized. Scientific racism provided biological justifications for Anglo-Saxon superiority. All of these different forms of knowledge reinforced the same basic message: the West belonged to white Americans by right of civilization.</p>
        
        <p><strong>It created identities.</strong> To be American increasingly meant to be expansionist, progressive, racially superior, and destined for greatness. Indigenous peoples became, by definition, obstacles to progress. Mexicans became inferior races incapable of properly developing the land. These weren't just prejudices—they were subject positions produced by the discourse itself.</p>
        
        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>Example in Practice:</h4>
            <p>When Americans debated the Mexican-American War, supporters didn't just argue it was advantageous or justified—they argued it was <em>inevitable</em>. The discourse of Manifest Destiny made certain kinds of arguments possible (this fulfills our destiny, we're bringing civilization) while making other arguments nearly unthinkable within mainstream debate (perhaps Indigenous peoples have equal claims to this land, perhaps we should respect Mexican sovereignty).</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Visual Culture as Discursive Artifacts</h2>
        
        <p>If Manifest Destiny functioned as a discourse, then paintings, photographs, maps, and illustrations were not merely <em>reflecting</em> that ideology—they were actively <em>producing and circulating</em> it. Visual culture made the discourse visible, tangible, and emotionally resonant in ways that words alone could not.</p>
        
        <h3>Painting the Destiny</h3>
        
        <p>Consider John Gast's 1872 painting <em>American Progress</em>, perhaps the most iconic visual representation of Manifest Destiny. In it, a floating angelic woman in flowing white robes—"Columbia," the personification of America—glides westward across the continent. She carries a schoolbook and telegraph wire, literally bringing enlightenment and technology. Before her, settlers, wagons, trains, and stagecoaches push forward. Behind her, the landscape is bright and cultivated. Ahead of her, in the darker western regions, Indigenous peoples and buffalo flee before the advancing civilization.</p>
        
        <p>This painting doesn't just <em>show</em> Manifest Destiny—it <strong>constructs</strong> it as visual truth. It organizes space (civilization moves from east to west, from light to darkness), time (progress moves in one inevitable direction), gender (expansion is both a masculine conquest and a feminine civilizing mission), and race (white Americans are agents of destiny; Indigenous peoples are anachronisms being swept away). The painting is a <strong>discursive artifact</strong>: a material object that embodies and reproduces the discourse's core assumptions.</p>
        
        <h3>Photography and the "Objective" West</h3>
        
        <p>Photography entered the picture—literally—as an even more powerful discursive tool because of its claim to objectivity. When photographers like Timothy O'Sullivan, William Henry Jackson, and Carleton Watkins accompanied western survey expeditions in the 1860s-1870s, their images were understood as scientific documents, not artistic interpretations. These photographs were "truth."</p>
        
        <p>But photographic truth was carefully constructed. Photographers chose their vantage points to emphasize geological wonders, vast empty spaces, and sublime landscapes that suggested unlimited potential. They often excluded or marginalized Indigenous presence, or when they did photograph Native peoples, positioned them as ethnographic specimens or symbols of a vanishing past. The very act of framing what to photograph—and what to leave out—was a discursive practice.</p>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>Photography as Discourse:</h3>
            <p>Survey photographs served multiple discursive functions: they provided "evidence" for congressional appropriations (look at these resources!), they satisfied eastern audiences' hunger for western imagery, they established American claims to territory, and they constructed the West as simultaneously virgin wilderness and promised land awaiting development. The camera didn't capture a pre-existing reality; it produced a particular vision of reality that aligned with expansionist discourse.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The technology of photography itself—its mechanical reproducibility, its circulation through government reports, stereoscope viewers in middle-class parlors, and illustrated magazines—meant that these discursive artifacts reached unprecedented audiences. Millions of Americans who would never go west "knew" what the West looked like through these carefully constructed images.</p>

        <h2>The "Vanishing Indian" as Embedded Discourse</h2>
        
        <p>Within the larger Manifest Destiny discourse operated a particularly insidious <strong>embedded discourse</strong>: the myth of the "Vanishing Indian." This sub-discourse did crucial ideological work by resolving a fundamental contradiction in American identity—how could a nation founded on principles of liberty and natural rights justify the dispossession and destruction of Indigenous peoples?</p>
        
        <h3>The Logic of Inevitable Disappearance</h3>
        
        <p>The "Vanishing Indian" discourse reframed ethnic cleansing as tragedy, violence as inevitability, and policy as natural law. According to this narrative, Indigenous peoples were disappearing not because of American actions, but because of some inherent biological, cultural, or spiritual weakness that made them unable to survive contact with civilization. They were, the discourse claimed, doomed by history itself.</p>
        
        <p>This discourse appeared everywhere in 19th-century American culture:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Literature:</strong> James Fenimore Cooper's <em>Last of the Mohicans</em> (1826) established the template—noble but doomed Indians fading into the wilderness as civilization advances</li>
            <li><strong>Poetry:</strong> Elegiac poems mourning the "vanishing race" proliferated, allowing white Americans to feel humanitarian sympathy while doing nothing to stop actual violence</li>
            <li><strong>Anthropology:</strong> "Salvage ethnography" operated on the assumption that Indigenous cultures were disappearing and needed to be documented before extinction</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Art:</strong> Paintings depicted "the last" of various tribes, Indians watching sunsets, or Indigenous people as ghostly presences in landscapes being transformed by settlement</li>
            <li><strong>Photography:</strong> Edward Curtis's early 20th-century photography project, while aesthetically powerful, reinforced vanishing discourse by staging "traditional" Indigenous life as if it existed outside of history and was naturally fading away</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>The Discursive Work Being Done:</h4>
            <p>Notice what the "Vanishing Indian" discourse accomplishes: It makes Indigenous disappearance appear natural rather than the result of specific policies (forced removal, reservation system, destruction of food sources, disease, warfare). It transforms perpetrators into witnesses or even mourners. It suggests that the "real" Indians are already gone, making contemporary Indigenous peoples somehow less authentic or less deserving of sovereignty. And crucially, it projects disappearance into the future as inevitable, thus justifying continued dispossession as merely hastening what must happen anyway.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Discourse Versus Reality</h3>
        
        <p>The power of discourse becomes clear when we recognize how the "Vanishing Indian" myth persisted—and persists—despite constantly being disproven by reality. Indigenous peoples did not vanish. They survived, adapted, resisted, and continue to assert sovereignty and presence today. Yet the discourse was so powerful that it shaped policy (why honor treaties with peoples assumed to be disappearing?), resource allocation (why invest in Indigenous futures?), and public consciousness (the shock many Americans express at learning Native peoples still exist).</p>
        
        <p>Understanding this as discourse helps us see that we're not just dealing with mistaken beliefs that can be corrected with better information. We're dealing with a knowledge system that had—and has—institutional support, that served specific interests (land acquisition, resource extraction, national identity formation), and that reproduced itself across multiple cultural forms.</p>

        <h2>Why This Analytical Approach Matters</h2>
        
        <p>Analyzing Manifest Destiny as discourse rather than merely as an idea or ideology gives us several advantages as historians:</p>
        
        <p><strong>It reveals how power works.</strong> Power doesn't just operate through force; it operates through knowledge systems that make certain arrangements of power seem natural, inevitable, or divinely ordained. Understanding discourse helps us see how expansion was made to feel like destiny rather than choice.</p>
        
        <p><strong>It connects culture to material reality.</strong> Paintings and photographs weren't just passive reflections of expansion—they were active agents in making expansion happen. They convinced congressmen to fund surveys, investors to back railroads, settlers to move west, and the public to support wars of conquest.</p>
        
        <p><strong>It explains persistence and resistance.</strong> Discourse analysis helps us understand why certain ideas persist long after they've been intellectually debunked (the "Vanishing Indian" myth continues despite Indigenous presence), and why resistance requires not just different policies but different ways of knowing and seeing.</p>
        
        <p><strong>It demands critical attention to sources.</strong> Once you understand discourse, you can't look at a survey photograph, a painting, or a policy document the same way. You start asking: What knowledge system produced this? Whose interests does it serve? What does it make visible, and what does it render invisible? What subject positions does it create?</p>
        
        <div class="pull-quote">
            "Every image of the West, every map, every travel narrative was not just showing Americans what was there—it was teaching them how to see, what to value, and who had the right to possess."
        </div>
        
        <p>This analytical approach doesn't mean that everyone who participated in this discourse was consciously manipulative or that individuals can't be held responsible for their actions. Rather, it means that understanding historical change requires us to examine not just what people did, but the systems of knowledge that made certain actions thinkable, justifiable, and even inevitable-seeming in their own time.</p>
        
        <p>The discourse of Manifest Destiny—and its embedded "Vanishing Indian" narrative—shows us how thoroughly ideas can shape material reality, how culture and power intertwine, and how the work of history involves not just chronicling events but excavating the knowledge systems that made those events possible.</p>
