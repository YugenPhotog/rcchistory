                    <h3>Opening (2-3 minutes)</h3>
                    <p>Welcome. Tonight we're looking at how Americans learned to see the West—not through experience, but through images. Between 1840 and 1910, landscape paintings, portrait photography, and staged scenes taught millions of Americans what the West looked like, who belonged there, and what the nation's westward expansion meant.</p>
                    <p>This isn't a story about accurate representation. It's about how images created a mythology so powerful that it shaped policy, justified violence, and still influences how we see the American West today.</p>
                    <p>We'll trace this visual tradition chronologically, watching a pattern emerge: landscapes painted as empty, Indigenous peoples portrayed as disappearing, white settlers framed as the future. By the end, we'll see how Edward Curtis crystallized this entire visual grammar into one phrase: "The Vanishing Race."</p>
                    <p>And then we'll ask: what actually vanished? Not Indigenous peoples—but the ability of many Americans to imagine them as modern, political, creative nations.</p>

                <p>Nature as National Destiny</p>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <h3>Section Introduction (1 minute)</h3>
                    <p>Let's begin with landscapes. Think of Thomas Cole, Frederic Church, Jasper Cropsey—giants of the Hudson River School. They're not just painting scenery; they're painting promise. Nature becomes a kind of scripture. The scale is vast, the land is pristine, and the brushwork suggests a world waiting patiently for human purpose.</p>
                    <p>Notice what they minimize: human presence. If anyone appears at all, they're small enough to be mistaken for a misplaced brushstroke. In paintings supposedly depicting a continent bustling with Native nations, trade routes, agricultural fields, and diplomatic relationships…there is often no Indigenous presence at all.</p>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Thomas Cole's "The Oxbow" (1836) shows the Connecticut River Valley. Notice the contrast: wild nature on the left, cultivated farmland on the right. This is visual rhetoric about civilization's progress. But where are the Algonquian peoples who lived here for millennia?</p>
                    <p>The tiny figure painting in the center is Cole himself, positioned as the artist-observer witnessing the transformation of wilderness into civilization. The painting suggests this is natural, inevitable, divinely ordained.</p>

                    <p>Church's "Heart of the Andes" (1859) was displayed with curtains and special lighting, creating a theatrical experience. Viewers paid admission to see it. The painting presents South American landscape as sublime, overwhelming, empty of human history.</p>
                    <p>This visual vocabulary—pristine wilderness, divine light, human insignificance—would be applied to North American landscapes, erasing Indigenous presence and suggesting land waiting to be claimed.</p>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Bierstadt's "Rocky Mountains" (1863) includes a Shoshone encampment in the foreground, but they're tiny, picturesque elements in a vast landscape. The painting was completed during the Civil War and exhibited in New York—Americans viewing it had never seen the West but were learning to imagine it as empty, available, magnificent.</p>
                    <p>The light is theatrical, almost supernatural. This isn't documentary; it's mythmaking. The West becomes a promised land, and Indigenous presence becomes decorative rather than political.</p>

                    <h3>Section Introduction (1 minute)</h3>
                    <p>Shift to George Catlin and Alfred Jacob Miller. Their portraits become a different kind of visual grammar: individuals presented in isolation, adorned in what the artist considers "traditional" attire, bodies often paused in a moment of timeless dignity.</p>
                    <p>Look closely at their technique. Catlin loved twilight—those fading-pastel backgrounds that make the sitter feel slightly removed from the present. Miller leans into the picturesque—romantic poses, dramatic lighting, subjects who look as if they've stepped out of an epic poem.</p>
                    <p>What's missing here isn't people—it's contemporaneity. These artists weren't particularly interested in Native political life, or diplomacy, or trade, or law, or the everyday texture of Indigenous societies in the 1830s and 1840s. They chose to portray Indigenous subjects as though they belonged to some earlier epoch.</p>

        <li>His portraits formed the government’s “Indian Gallery,” displayed in the War Department—the same place coordinating removal policy.</li>
        <li>He presents his sitters against neutral backgrounds, emphasizing “traditional” clothing and dignified stillness.</li>
        <li>The effect is a portrait style that freezes living political leaders as if they belonged to an earlier, disappearing world.</li>

            <section class="text-slide" data-voiceover="audio/Cassidy_v3_catlin.mp3">
                <h2>George Catlin</h2>
                <ul>
        <li>George Catlin was an American painter and traveler who spent the 1830s moving through the Great Plains, painting Mandan, Hidatsa, Blackfeet, Crow, and many other nations.</li>
        <li>He described his mission as “rescuing from oblivion” the looks and customs of Native peoples he believed were a “vanishing” race.</li>
        <li>Catlin often staged his sitters in ceremonial dress and dramatic poses, emphasizing the exotic and timeless rather than everyday life.</li>
        <li>He toured his massive “Indian Gallery” in the U.S. and Europe, promoting it as a last visual record of nations supposedly “hastening before the progress of civilization.”</li>
        <li>The result is a deep contradiction: he preserved invaluable visual records of living cultures while framing them through a story of inevitable disappearance.</li>
    </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>George Catlin is crucial to understanding how the "vanishing race" narrative developed. He explicitly used this phrase to describe his mission. In the 1830s, the Plains tribes he painted—Mandans, Hidatsas, Blackfeet, Crows—were still largely living their traditional lifeways. The ceremonial regalia and traditional dress were genuinely part of their active cultures.</p>
                    <p>But Catlin engaged in staging—asking subjects to wear their finest ceremonial clothing, which wasn't everyday wear. He was selective, emphasizing the "exotic" and ceremonial over the mundane. And crucially, he framed everything through his "vanishing race" narrative, claiming he was creating a last record before inevitable disappearance.</p>
                    <p>This ignored Native agency, adaptation, and survival. His later work with his touring "Indian Gallery" definitely played up romantic primitivism for white audiences. So in the 1830s, he was largely documenting actual living cultures, but through a selective, romanticizing lens that served his own narrative purposes.</p>

                <h2>George Catlin's Indian Portraits: Authentic or Staged?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Reality:</strong> More nuanced than simple misrepresentation</li>
                    <li><strong>What Catlin Actually Painted (1830s):</strong> In this decade, Plains tribes like the Mandans, Hidatsas, Blackfeet, and Crows were still largely living their traditional lifeways. The ceremonial regalia, buffalo-skin lodges, and traditional dress were genuinely part of their active, living cultures—not reconstructions or costumes.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Staging Element:</strong> Catlin did ask subjects to wear their finest ceremonial clothing for portraits, which wasn't everyday wear. He was selective, emphasizing the "exotic" and ceremonial over the mundane—like asking someone to dress up for a formal portrait rather than wearing work clothes.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Real Problem:</strong> The misrepresentation came in how his work was used and interpreted. Catlin promoted the "vanishing race" narrative—claiming Native peoples were inevitably disappearing and he was creating a last record. This ignored Native agency, adaptation, and survival. His touring "Indian Gallery" (1840s-1850s) played up romantic primitivism for white audiences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> In the 1830s, Catlin documented actual living cultures, but through a selective, romanticizing lens that served his own narrative purposes and white expectations.</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is important nuance: Catlin wasn't completely fabricating what he painted. In the 1830s, these were living cultures. But his selection of what to paint, how to frame it, and especially his narrative framing—the "vanishing race" language—created a distorted picture that served white American expectations and justified dispossession.</p>

                <p>Photography's "Truth"</p>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <h3>Section Introduction (1 minute)</h3>
                    <p>Now we enter the world of early photography. The daguerreotype—popular in the 1840s and 1850s—was widely believed to be an unfiltered truth machine. "The camera cannot lie," people said. Of course, the camera lies all the time.</p>
                    <p>Think about daguerreotypes of Native diplomats and political leaders made in Washington, D.C. The subjects sit stiffly, often wearing clothing chosen not by themselves but by the studio. The background is a curtain; the context is removed. A chief who is in town negotiating a treaty is shown instead as an anonymous figure of "Indianness," timeless and abstract.</p>
                    <p>Photography becomes a paradox: it feels factual, but it erases history. No hint of the debates happening in Congress, no glimpse of Native newspapers, no sign of the complex political strategies unfolding across the Great Plains and the Southwest. The photograph freezes a person in a moment that implies permanence.</p>

                    <li><strong>The pattern emerging:</strong> Landscapes with no Native presence + portraits suggesting an older world + photographs stripping away politics = a systematic erasure</li>

                    <p>That belief—which we still carry today—made the photographic portrayal of the West immensely influential. What the camera framed became what people believed. This set the stage for Curtis's enormous cultural impact.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The myth of "mechanical truth":</strong> Photography was believed to capture reality without bias or interpretation</li>
                    <li><strong>The reality:</strong> Every photograph involves choices
                        <ul>
                            <li>Photographer chooses framing</li>
                            <li>Photographer chooses timing</li>

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The danger:</strong> Photography claimed authority without accountability—people believed they were seeing "truth" when they were actually seeing the photographer's vision</li>
                    <li><strong>The impact on the West:</strong> Photographic "evidence" of Indigenous peoples as timeless, disappearing figures became accepted as fact rather than interpretation</li>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is crucial: the belief in photographic objectivity made photographic lies more powerful than painted ones. When Catlin painted romantic portraits, viewers understood those were artistic interpretations. But when photographers created the same romantic, decontextualized images, viewers believed they were seeing unmediated truth.</p>
                    <p>Every photograph is an argument. Every photograph reflects the photographer's choices about what to show and what to hide. But the medium's claim to mechanical objectivity disguises those choices.</p>

Now meet the artist who tied all of that together and exported it. Frederic Remington is the bridge between frontier mythology and American empire — his visual logic is the same logic, applied to new geography.</p>

    <ul style="font-size:2.0em;">
        <li><strong>America's most famous illustrator</strong> — cowboys, cavalry, Native warriors on the Plains</li>
        <li>His images defined what the <em>mythic West</em> looked like for millions of Americans who never went there</li>
        <li>By the 1890s, his visual grammar — <strong>masculine, violent, heroic</strong> — was the dominant image of frontier America</li>
        <li>Deep friendship with Theodore Roosevelt — illustrated Roosevelt's own writings on the West</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bottom-text" style="font-size:1.8em;">He didn't document the frontier — he <strong>invented</strong> it for mass consumption</p>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>Remington studied briefly at Yale School of Art before heading west on sketching trips in the 1880s. He became the visual chronicler of the cavalry, the cowboy, and the Native warrior — always from a white, Eastern perspective that romanticized violence and framed conquest as heroism. His work appeared in Harper's Weekly and Collier's, making him a household name. Roosevelt and Remington shared the same ideology: the West as crucible of American manhood, the frontier as proving ground.</p>

        <p>Remington at the height of his frontier period. Cowboys fleeing Native pursuers — chaos, speed, masculine urgency. The composition is cinematic before cinema existed. Notice: the cowboys are individualized, expressive, fully human. The Native pursuers are a mass, faceless, threatening. This is the same visual logic as Curtis — one group has interiority, the other is background. Remington's frontier is always a stage for white heroism.</p>

        <p>This painting appeared in 1895 — the same year Turner's Frontier Thesis was circulating widely. The cowboy dismounts at a fence line, the open range behind him, the closed gate ahead. Remington is mourning the end of the frontier world he had mythologized. The irony: the frontier he mourned was already a myth. The open range of his paintings was never as empty or as free as he painted it. But the mourning was real, and it would drive Remington toward a new canvas — Cuba.</p>

        <p>Cavalry soldiers under ambush. Remington returns again and again to this moment — the white soldier in danger, surrounded, tested. The visual argument is always the same: American manhood proven through conflict with non-white adversaries. This painting comes after the Spanish-American War, but the logic is identical to his 1880s frontier work. The enemy has changed; the visual grammar hasn't.</p>

        <p>Remington didn't change when he went to Cuba — he applied the same visual logic to a new geography. Hearst understood exactly what he was purchasing: not documentation, but mythology. The same machinery that made Americans believe the West was empty and available made them believe Cuba was helpless and waiting. The famous (possibly apocryphal) Hearst telegram — "You furnish the pictures, I'll furnish the war" — captures the attitude whether or not the words were actually spoken.</p>

        <p>The circle closes. The same man who painted cavalry charges on the Plains painted Roosevelt's Rough Riders charging up San Juan Hill. The composition is nearly identical — heroic figures, forward momentum, ordained triumph. The West had been won. Cuba was next. The visual grammar traveled with the empire.</p>

                    <p>Now we stop withholding. Curtis enters around 1890–1910 and gathers the visual habits Americans had absorbed over seventy years. He stages scenes using older clothing, removes signs of modern life, edits out clocks, wagons, fences, sewing machines, and metal tools. He even retouches photographs to erase evidence of Native modernity.</p>
                    <p>Then he names his most famous image "The Vanishing Race."</p>
                    <p>This is the moment when students realize: Everything they've been noticing had a cultural destination. The earlier landscapes, portraits, and daguerreotypes weren't random. They prepared Americans to believe that Indigenous peoples were fading away, relics of premodern time. Curtis did not invent this idea; he crystallized it, aestheticized it, and marketed it in twenty volumes.</p>

                    <p>Curtis's most famous image. Native riders disappearing into shadow, literally titled "The Vanishing Race." This is the crystallization of seventy years of visual rhetoric. The image is beautiful, haunting, and fundamentally dishonest. Indigenous peoples weren't vanishing—they were being systematically dispossessed, confined to reservations, and subjected to assimilation policies. But Curtis frames it as natural, inevitable, elegiac.</p>

                <h2>Reservation-Era Modernity: The Truth Curtis Hid</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>By the 1890s-early 1900s, Indigenous nations were:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Forming political organizations</li>
                            <li>Publishing newspapers</li>
                            <li>Fighting court cases over land and sovereignty</li>
                            <li>Sending children to tribal-run schools</li>
                            <li>Creating new art forms</li>
                            <li>Blending traditional governance with new strategies</li>
                            <li>Wearing both traditional and modern clothing</li>
                            <li>Shaping pan-tribal movements</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The truth:</strong> Curtis's world is not a record of Indigenous society—it is a record of his own imagination</li>
                    <li><strong>The reality:</strong> Reservation-era life was complex, creative, adaptive, and fiercely modern</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is crucial. The "vanishing race" was never vanishing. Indigenous peoples were adapting, resisting, surviving, and creating new forms of political and cultural expression even as they faced systematic oppression and violence.</p>

Tribal governments exercise sovereignty. Indigenous scholars, artists, activists, writers are creating vibrant contemporary cultures while maintaining connections to deep histories.</p>
                    <p>Indigenous peoples didn't survive by remaining frozen in some imagined traditional past. They survived by adapting, by being strategic, by holding onto what mattered while changing what needed to change. They survived through incredible resistance, resilience, and creativity in the face of systematic attempts at cultural and physical genocide.</p>
