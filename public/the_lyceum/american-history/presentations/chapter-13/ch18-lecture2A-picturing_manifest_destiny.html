                <h2>Part III: Daguerreotypes of Native Leaders</h2>

                <p>Photography's "Truth"</p>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <h3>Section Introduction (1 minute)</h3>
                    <p>Now we enter the world of early photography. The daguerreotype—popular in the 1840s and 1850s—was widely believed to be an unfiltered truth machine. "The camera cannot lie," people said. Of course, the camera lies all the time.</p>
                    <p>Think about daguerreotypes of Native diplomats and political leaders made in Washington, D.C. The subjects sit stiffly, often wearing clothing chosen not by themselves but by the studio. The background is a curtain; the context is removed. A chief who is in town negotiating a treaty is shown instead as an anonymous figure of "Indianness," timeless and abstract.</p>
                    <p>Photography becomes a paradox: it feels factual, but it erases history. No hint of the debates happening in Congress, no glimpse of Native newspapers, no sign of the complex political strategies unfolding across the Great Plains and the Southwest. The photograph freezes a person in a moment that implies permanence.</p>

                    <li><strong>The reality:</strong> The camera lies all the time</li>

                            <li>Backgrounds were curtains—context removed</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>What's missing:</strong> No hint of Congressional debates, Native newspapers, or complex political strategies unfolding across the Great Plains and Southwest</li>
                    <li><strong>The paradox:</strong> Photography feels factual, but it erases history. The photograph freezes a person in a moment that implies permanence—stripping away politics and modernity</li>
                    <li><strong>The pattern emerging:</strong> Landscapes with no Native presence + portraits suggesting an older world + photographs stripping away politics = a systematic erasure</li>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>By this point, students have three sets of images: landscapes with no Native presence, portraits that suggest an older world, photographs that strip away politics and modernity. The repetition builds pressure. They're already solving the puzzle.</p>

                    <li><strong>By the 1860s-1870s:</strong> Photographers like Mathew Brady, Southworth & Hawes, and Timothy O'Sullivan taught Americans that photographs were windows onto reality</li>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Before we move to Curtis, we need one more tool on the table: photography's cultural power. By the 1860s and 1870s, Brady, Southworth & Hawes, and Timothy O'Sullivan had taught Americans that photographs were windows onto reality. Photographs became data, evidence, proof.</p>
                    <p>That belief—which we still carry today—made the photographic portrayal of the West immensely influential. What the camera framed became what people believed. This set the stage for Curtis's enormous cultural impact.</p>

            <section class="text-slide" data-autoslide="0">
                <h2>Photography's "Objective" Lie</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The myth of "mechanical truth":</strong> Photography was believed to capture reality without bias or interpretation</li>
                    <li><strong>The reality:</strong> Every photograph involves choices
                        <ul>
                            <li>Photographer chooses framing</li>
                            <li>Photographer chooses timing</li>
                            <li>Photographer chooses subjects</li>
                            <li>Photographer chooses what to include—and what to exclude</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The danger:</strong> Photography claimed authority without accountability—people believed they were seeing "truth" when they were actually seeing the photographer's vision</li>
                    <li><strong>The impact on the West:</strong> Photographic "evidence" of Indigenous peoples as timeless, disappearing figures became accepted as fact rather than interpretation</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is crucial: the belief in photographic objectivity made photographic lies more powerful than painted ones. When Catlin painted romantic portraits, viewers understood those were artistic interpretations. But when photographers created the same romantic, decontextualized images, viewers believed they were seeing unmediated truth.</p>
                    <p>Every photograph is an argument. Every photograph reflects the photographer's choices about what to show and what to hide. But the medium's claim to mechanical objectivity disguises those choices.</p>

                    <h3>Section Introduction (1 minute)</h3>
                    <p>Now we stop withholding. Curtis enters around 1890–1910 and gathers the visual habits Americans had absorbed over seventy years. He stages scenes using older clothing, removes signs of modern life, edits out clocks, wagons, fences, sewing machines, and metal tools. He even retouches photographs to erase evidence of Native modernity.</p>
                    <p>Then he names his most famous image "The Vanishing Race."</p>
                    <p>This is the moment when students realize: Everything they've been noticing had a cultural destination. The earlier landscapes, portraits, and daguerreotypes weren't random. They prepared Americans to believe that Indigenous peoples were fading away, relics of premodern time. Curtis did not invent this idea; he crystallized it, aestheticized it, and marketed it in twenty volumes.</p>

                    <p>Curtis's most famous image. Native riders disappearing into shadow, literally titled "The Vanishing Race." This is the crystallization of seventy years of visual rhetoric. The image is beautiful, haunting, and fundamentally dishonest. Indigenous peoples weren't vanishing—they were being systematically dispossessed, confined to reservations, and subjected to assimilation policies. But Curtis frames it as natural, inevitable, elegiac.</p>

                    <p>Chief Joseph was a brilliant military strategist and diplomat who fought a sophisticated campaign against U.S. forces in 1877. But Curtis photographs him decades later in traditional regalia, removed from political context, suggesting timelessness rather than contemporary resistance and ongoing struggle for justice.</p>

                <h2>Reservation-Era Modernity: The Truth Curtis Hid</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>By the 1890s-early 1900s, Indigenous nations were:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Forming political organizations</li>
                            <li>Publishing newspapers</li>
                            <li>Fighting court cases over land and sovereignty</li>
                            <li>Sending children to tribal-run schools</li>
                            <li>Creating new art forms</li>
                            <li>Blending traditional governance with new strategies</li>
                            <li>Wearing both traditional and modern clothing</li>
                            <li>Shaping pan-tribal movements</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The truth:</strong> Curtis's world is not a record of Indigenous society—it is a record of his own imagination</li>
                    <li><strong>The reality:</strong> Reservation-era life was complex, creative, adaptive, and fiercely modern</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is crucial. The "vanishing race" was never vanishing. Indigenous peoples were adapting, resisting, surviving, and creating new forms of political and cultural expression even as they faced systematic oppression and violence.</p>

                <h2>What Curtis Refused to Photograph</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reservation confinement (1870s-1920s):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Poverty, disease, ration systems</li>

                            <li>Forced assimilation policies</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Indigenous people living in modernity:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adaptation, not disappearance</li>
                            <li>Mixed economies, new technologies</li>
                            <li>Maintaining identity while changing</li>
                            <li>Fighting for sovereignty through law and politics</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Curtis's erasure:</strong> He deliberately removed all evidence of this complex, modern reality to create his fantasy of timeless, disappearing peoples</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Curtis had a camera. He could have photographed reservation poverty, political organizing, adaptation to modern life. Instead, he traveled with trunks of "traditional" clothing and props, staging scenes that fit his preconceived narrative. He literally edited modernity out of his photographs—retouching images to remove clocks, modern clothing, anything that suggested contemporary life.</p>

                    <p>The "vanishing race" never vanished. This was always a lie, always a myth designed to make genocide acceptable. There are 574 federally recognized tribes in the United States today. Millions of people identify as Native American or Alaska Native. Indigenous languages are being revitalized. Tribal governments exercise sovereignty. Indigenous scholars, artists, activists, writers are creating vibrant contemporary cultures while maintaining connections to deep histories.</p>
                    <p>Indigenous peoples didn't survive by remaining frozen in some imagined traditional past. They survived by adapting, by being strategic, by holding onto what mattered while changing what needed to change. They survived through incredible resistance, resilience, and creativity in the face of systematic attempts at cultural and physical genocide.</p>

                            <li>Daguerreotypes made them look <em>frozen outside history</em></li>
                            <li>Frontier paintings made settlers look like the <em>rightful heirs</em></li>

                    <li><strong>The Truth:</strong> Indigenous nations did not vanish. What vanished was the ability of many 19th-century Americans to imagine them as modern, political, creative nations.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Images shape imagination—and imagination shapes history.</li>
