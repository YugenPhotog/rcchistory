                    <h3>Opening (2-3 minutes)</h3>
                    <p>Welcome. Tonight we're looking at how Americans learned to see the West—not through experience, but through images. Between 1840 and 1910, landscape paintings, portrait photography, and staged scenes taught millions of Americans what the West looked like, who belonged there, and what the nation's westward expansion meant.</p>
                    <p>This isn't a story about accurate representation. It's about how images created a mythology so powerful that it shaped policy, justified violence, and still influences how we see the American West today.</p>
                    <p>We'll trace this visual tradition chronologically, watching a pattern emerge: landscapes painted as empty, Indigenous peoples portrayed as disappearing, white settlers framed as the future. By the end, we'll see how Edward Curtis crystallized this entire visual grammar into one phrase: "The Vanishing Race."</p>
                    <p>And then we'll ask: what actually vanished? Not Indigenous peoples—but the ability of many Americans to imagine them as modern, political, creative nations.</p>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <h3>Section Introduction (1 minute)</h3>
                    <p>Let's begin with landscapes. Think of Thomas Cole, Frederic Church, Jasper Cropsey—giants of the Hudson River School. They're not just painting scenery; they're painting promise. Nature becomes a kind of scripture. The scale is vast, the land is pristine, and the brushwork suggests a world waiting patiently for human purpose.</p>
                    <p>Notice what they minimize: human presence. If anyone appears at all, they're small enough to be mistaken for a misplaced brushstroke. In paintings supposedly depicting a continent bustling with Native nations, trade routes, agricultural fields, and diplomatic relationships…there is often no Indigenous presence at all.</p>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Thomas Cole's "The Oxbow" (1836) shows the Connecticut River Valley. Notice the contrast: wild nature on the left, cultivated farmland on the right. This is visual rhetoric about civilization's progress. But where are the Algonquian peoples who lived here for millennia?</p>
                    <p>The tiny figure painting in the center is Cole himself, positioned as the artist-observer witnessing the transformation of wilderness into civilization. The painting suggests this is natural, inevitable, divinely ordained.</p>

                    <p>Church's "Heart of the Andes" (1859) was displayed with curtains and special lighting, creating a theatrical experience. Viewers paid admission to see it. The painting presents South American landscape as sublime, overwhelming, empty of human history.</p>
                    <p>This visual vocabulary—pristine wilderness, divine light, human insignificance—would be applied to North American landscapes, erasing Indigenous presence and suggesting land waiting to be claimed.</p>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Bierstadt's "Rocky Mountains" (1863) includes a Shoshone encampment in the foreground, but they're tiny, picturesque elements in a vast landscape. The painting was completed during the Civil War and exhibited in New York—Americans viewing it had never seen the West but were learning to imagine it as empty, available, magnificent.</p>
                    <p>The light is theatrical, almost supernatural. This isn't documentary; it's mythmaking. The West becomes a promised land, and Indigenous presence becomes decorative rather than political.</p>

                    <h3>Section Introduction (1 minute)</h3>
                    <p>Shift to George Catlin and Alfred Jacob Miller. Their portraits become a different kind of visual grammar: individuals presented in isolation, adorned in what the artist considers "traditional" attire, bodies often paused in a moment of timeless dignity.</p>
                    <p>Look closely at their technique. Catlin loved twilight—those fading-pastel backgrounds that make the sitter feel slightly removed from the present. Miller leans into the picturesque—romantic poses, dramatic lighting, subjects who look as if they've stepped out of an epic poem.</p>
                    <p>What's missing here isn't people—it's contemporaneity. These artists weren't particularly interested in Native political life, or diplomacy, or trade, or law, or the everyday texture of Indigenous societies in the 1830s and 1840s. They chose to portray Indigenous subjects as though they belonged to some earlier epoch.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Who he was:</strong> Washington D.C.-based portrait painter (1785-1862)</li>
                    <li><strong>His major project:</strong> Painted Native American delegations visiting Washington for treaty negotiations in the 1820s-1830s</li>
                    <li><strong>Where his work appeared:</strong> Commissioned by the U.S. government's "Indian Gallery" in the War Department</li>
                    <li><strong>What makes his work significant:</strong> Created some of the most widely circulated images of Native leaders—but painted them as diplomats <em>passing through</em> rather than nations <em>persisting</em></li>
                    <li><strong>The tension:</strong> His subjects were active political leaders negotiating treaties, yet King's style often suggested they were figures from a disappearing world</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Charles Bird King worked in Washington D.C., painting Native delegations that came to negotiate treaties. These were active political leaders engaging in diplomacy, but King's portraits often strip away that context. The backgrounds are neutral, the clothing emphasized as exotic, the faces dignified but removed from political struggle.</p>
                    <p>King's work was commissioned by the government and displayed in the War Department's "Indian Gallery." Think about that: images of Native leaders displayed in the very building coordinating their removal and military suppression.</p>

                <h2>George Catlin</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Who he was:</strong> American painter and traveler (1796-1872)</li>
                    <li><strong>His mission (in his own words):</strong> "rescuing from oblivion the looks and customs of the vanishing races of native man in America"</li>
                    <li><strong>His subjects:</strong> Traveled extensively through the Great Plains in the 1830s, painting Mandans, Hidatsas, Blackfeet, Crows, and dozens of other Native nations—over 500 paintings total</li>
                    <li><strong>His "Indian Gallery":</strong> Toured his collection throughout the U.S. and Europe, promoting it as a record of peoples "hastening before the approach and certain progress of civilization"</li>
                    <li><strong>The contradiction:</strong> In the 1830s, he documented <em>living cultures</em>—but framed them through the lens of inevitable disappearance</li>
                    <li><strong>His legacy:</strong> Created invaluable visual records, but also popularized the "vanishing race" narrative that denied Native agency and survival</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>George Catlin is crucial to understanding how the "vanishing race" narrative developed. He explicitly used this phrase to describe his mission. In the 1830s, the Plains tribes he painted—Mandans, Hidatsas, Blackfeet, Crows—were still largely living their traditional lifeways. The ceremonial regalia and traditional dress were genuinely part of their active cultures.</p>
                    <p>But Catlin engaged in staging—asking subjects to wear their finest ceremonial clothing, which wasn't everyday wear. He was selective, emphasizing the "exotic" and ceremonial over the mundane. And crucially, he framed everything through his "vanishing race" narrative, claiming he was creating a last record before inevitable disappearance.</p>
                    <p>This ignored Native agency, adaptation, and survival. His later work with his touring "Indian Gallery" definitely played up romantic primitivism for white audiences. So in the 1830s, he was largely documenting actual living cultures, but through a selective, romanticizing lens that served his own narrative purposes.</p>

            <section class="text-slide">
                <h2>George Catlin's Indian Portraits: Authentic or Staged?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Reality:</strong> More nuanced than simple misrepresentation</li>
                    <li><strong>What Catlin Actually Painted (1830s):</strong> In this decade, Plains tribes like the Mandans, Hidatsas, Blackfeet, and Crows were still largely living their traditional lifeways. The ceremonial regalia, buffalo-skin lodges, and traditional dress were genuinely part of their active, living cultures—not reconstructions or costumes.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Staging Element:</strong> Catlin did ask subjects to wear their finest ceremonial clothing for portraits, which wasn't everyday wear. He was selective, emphasizing the "exotic" and ceremonial over the mundane—like asking someone to dress up for a formal portrait rather than wearing work clothes.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Real Problem:</strong> The misrepresentation came in how his work was used and interpreted. Catlin promoted the "vanishing race" narrative—claiming Native peoples were inevitably disappearing and he was creating a last record. This ignored Native agency, adaptation, and survival. His touring "Indian Gallery" (1840s-1850s) played up romantic primitivism for white audiences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> In the 1830s, Catlin documented actual living cultures, but through a selective, romanticizing lens that served his own narrative purposes and white expectations.</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is important nuance: Catlin wasn't completely fabricating what he painted. In the 1830s, these were living cultures. But his selection of what to paint, how to frame it, and especially his narrative framing—the "vanishing race" language—created a distorted picture that served white American expectations and justified dispossession.</p>

                    <p>Catlin's twilight backgrounds and romantic lighting remove the subject from contemporary context. This is a living person in the 1830s, but the visual treatment suggests someone from a different time. The "vanishing race" narrative is built into the aesthetic choices.</p>

                    <h3>Section Introduction (1 minute)</h3>
                    <p>Now we enter the world of early photography. The daguerreotype—popular in the 1840s and 1850s—was widely believed to be an unfiltered truth machine. "The camera cannot lie," people said. Of course, the camera lies all the time.</p>
                    <p>Think about daguerreotypes of Native diplomats and political leaders made in Washington, D.C. The subjects sit stiffly, often wearing clothing chosen not by themselves but by the studio. The background is a curtain; the context is removed. A chief who is in town negotiating a treaty is shown instead as an anonymous figure of "Indianness," timeless and abstract.</p>
                    <p>Photography becomes a paradox: it feels factual, but it erases history. No hint of the debates happening in Congress, no glimpse of Native newspapers, no sign of the complex political strategies unfolding across the Great Plains and the Southwest. The photograph freezes a person in a moment that implies permanence.</p>

                <h2>Photography's "Objective" Lie</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The myth of "mechanical truth":</strong> Photography was believed to capture reality without bias or interpretation</li>
                    <li><strong>The reality:</strong> Every photograph involves choices
                        <ul>
                            <li>Photographer chooses framing</li>
                            <li>Photographer chooses timing</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The danger:</strong> Photography claimed authority without accountability—people believed they were seeing "truth" when they were actually seeing the photographer's vision</li>
                    <li><strong>The impact on the West:</strong> Photographic "evidence" of Indigenous peoples as timeless, disappearing figures became accepted as fact rather than interpretation</li>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is crucial: the belief in photographic objectivity made photographic lies more powerful than painted ones. When Catlin painted romantic portraits, viewers understood those were artistic interpretations. But when photographers created the same romantic, decontextualized images, viewers believed they were seeing unmediated truth.</p>
                    <p>Every photograph is an argument. Every photograph reflects the photographer's choices about what to show and what to hide. But the medium's claim to mechanical objectivity disguises those choices.</p>

                    <p>Now we stop withholding. Curtis enters around 1890–1910 and gathers the visual habits Americans had absorbed over seventy years.

He even retouches photographs to erase evidence of Native modernity.</p>
                    <p>Then he names his most famous image "The Vanishing Race."</p>
                    <p>This is the moment when students realize: Everything they've been noticing had a cultural destination. The earlier landscapes, portraits, and daguerreotypes weren't random. They prepared Americans to believe that Indigenous peoples were fading away, relics of premodern time.

                    <p>You cannot end on Curtis. This is where we restore the world he erased.</p>
                    <p>By the 1890s and early 1900s, Indigenous nations were forming political organizations, publishing newspapers, fighting court cases over land and sovereignty, sending children to tribal-run schools, creating new art forms, blending traditional governance with new strategies, wearing both traditional and modern clothing, and shaping pan-tribal movements.</p>
                    <p>Curtis's world is not a record of Indigenous society—it is a record of his own imagination. Reservation-era life was complex, creative, adaptive, and fiercely modern.</p>

                    <li><strong>By the 1890s-early 1900s, Indigenous nations were:</strong>

                            <li>Forming political organizations</li>
                            <li>Publishing newspapers</li>
                            <li>Fighting court cases over land and sovereignty</li>
                            <li>Sending children to tribal-run schools</li>
                            <li>Creating new art forms</li>
                            <li>Blending traditional governance with new strategies</li>
                            <li>Wearing both traditional and modern clothing</li>
                            <li>Shaping pan-tribal movements</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The truth:</strong> Curtis's world is not a record of Indigenous society—it is a record of his own imagination</li>
                    <li><strong>The reality:</strong> Reservation-era life was complex, creative, adaptive, and fiercely modern</li>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This is crucial. The "vanishing race" was never vanishing. Indigenous peoples were adapting, resisting, surviving, and creating new forms of political and cultural expression even as they faced systematic oppression and violence.</p>

                <h2>What Curtis Refused to Photograph</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reservation confinement (1870s-1920s):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Poverty, disease, ration systems</li>

                            <li>Forced assimilation policies</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Indigenous people living in modernity:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adaptation, not disappearance</li>
                            <li>Mixed economies, new technologies</li>
                            <li>Maintaining identity while changing</li>
                            <li>Fighting for sovereignty through law and politics</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Curtis's erasure:</strong> He deliberately removed all evidence of this complex, modern reality to create his fantasy of timeless, disappearing peoples</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Curtis had a camera. He could have photographed reservation poverty, political organizing, adaptation to modern life. Instead, he traveled with trunks of "traditional" clothing and props, staging scenes that fit his preconceived narrative. He literally edited modernity out of his photographs—retouching images to remove clocks, modern clothing, anything that suggested contemporary life.</p>

                    <p>The "vanishing race" never vanished. This was always a lie, always a myth designed to make genocide acceptable. There are 574 federally recognized tribes in the United States today. Millions of people identify as Native American or Alaska Native. Indigenous languages are being revitalized. Tribal governments exercise sovereignty. Indigenous scholars, artists, activists, writers are creating vibrant contemporary cultures while maintaining connections to deep histories.</p>
                    <p>Indigenous peoples didn't survive by remaining frozen in some imagined traditional past. They survived by adapting, by being strategic, by holding onto what mattered while changing what needed to change. They survived through incredible resistance, resilience, and creativity in the face of systematic attempts at cultural and physical genocide.</p>

                    <p>You bring it all home: Landscapes made the continent look empty. Portraits made Native people look timeless. Daguerreotypes made them look frozen outside history.
