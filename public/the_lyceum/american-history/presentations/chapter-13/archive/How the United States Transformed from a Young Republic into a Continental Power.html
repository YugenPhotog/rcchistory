                    Welcome. Today we're examining one of the most consequential decades in American history—the 1840s—when the United States transformed from a republic hugging the Atlantic seaboard into a continental power stretching to the Pacific. This wasn't accidental; it was deliberate, rationalized, and executed with remarkable speed. We'll explore how Americans justified this expansion, what tools they used, and why it ultimately made the Civil War nearly inevitable.

            <section>
                <h2>I. Thesis & Framework</h2>
                <h3>Core Argument</h3>
                <p>U.S. expansion in the 1840s = <strong>national mission</strong>, not imperial conquest</p>
                
                <h3>Rooted in Three Realities</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Demographic pressure</li>
                    <li>Institutional superiority</li>
                    <li>Providential duty</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Path to Continental Power</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manifest Destiny ideology</li>
                    <li>Presidential leadership (Polk)</li>
                    <li>Mexican-American War</li>
                    <li>Compromise of 1850</li>
                    <li><strong>Slavery made Civil War probable</strong></li>
                </ul>
                
                <aside class="notes">
                    Our thesis: Americans in the 1840s understood expansion as a national mission, not imperial conquest. They believed they had demographic pressure—a rapidly growing population needing land. They believed in institutional superiority—that their republican system was the best form of government. And they believed in providential duty—that God had ordained them to spread across the continent. This lecture tracks five key developments: Manifest Destiny as ideology, James K. Polk's aggressive presidency, the Mexican-American War, the Compromise of 1850, and the central problem—slavery's expansion made the Civil War almost certain. Estimated time: 4 minutes.

            <!-- Slide 3: Contested Consensus -->
            <section>
                <h2>Contested Consensus</h2>
                <h3>Manifest Destiny Unified Rhetoric…</h3>
                <p>…but <strong>divided politics</strong></p>
                
                <h3>Key Dissenters</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Abolitionists</strong> (Garrison, Whittier)</li>
                    <li><strong>Whigs</strong> (Adams, Greeley)</li>
                    <li><strong>Thoreau</strong> (<em>Civil Disobedience</em>, 1849)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Wilmot Proviso (1846)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>First attempt to <strong>ban slavery</strong> in Mexican Cession</li>
                    <li>Passed House → failed Senate</li>
                </ul>
                
                <aside class="notes">
                    Important clarification: Manifest Destiny wasn't universally accepted. Abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison and John Greenleaf Whittier saw expansion as a slaveholder's conspiracy. Whigs like John Quincy Adams and Horace Greeley feared military adventurism and executive overreach. Henry David Thoreau wrote "Civil Disobedience" in 1849 in direct response to the Mexican War. The Wilmot Proviso of 1846 tried to ban slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico—it passed the House but failed in the Senate, exposing the sectional divide that would only worsen. This wasn't unanimous nationalism; it was contested from the start.

            <section>
                <h2>II. Manifest Destiny: Six Justifications</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Providential Allotment</h3>
                <blockquote>"Vast theater for republican experiment"</blockquote>
                
                <h3>2. Demographic Imperative</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>9.6M (1820) → 23.2M (1850)</li>
                    <li>Land = <strong>safety valve</strong> for equality</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>3. Anglo-Saxon Racial Mission</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Institutions + race = suited for liberty</li>
                    <li>Displace "inferior systems"</li>
                </ul>
                
                <aside class="notes">
                    Now let's examine the six pillars of Manifest Destiny. First, providential allotment: Americans believed God had set aside the continent as a "vast theater" for their republican experiment. Second, demographic imperative: the U.S. population more than doubled from 9.6 million in 1820 to 23.2 million in 1850. Land was seen as a safety valve—endless territory meant economic opportunity and preserved equality. Third, Anglo-Saxon racial mission: this is uncomfortable but essential. Most white Americans believed their race and institutions uniquely suited them for liberty and self-government, and that they had a duty to displace "inferior systems"—meaning Native peoples and Mexicans. This racial logic permeated expansionist thought.

            <section>
                <h2>II. Justifications (continued)</h2>
                
                <h3>4. Ethical Exceptionalism</h3>
                <blockquote>"Freest, happiest, most moral" – <em>1845 Journal</em></blockquote>
                
                <h3>5. Anti-Centralization (Jacksonian)</h3>
                <blockquote>"More states = weaker federal power" – Rep. Duncan</blockquote>
                
                <h3>6. Economic Rationalism</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>$15M for 525K square miles</li>
                    <li>"Greatest real estate deal in history"</li>
                </ul>
                
                <aside class="notes">
                    Fourth, ethical exceptionalism: an 1845 journal claimed America was the "freest, happiest, most moral" nation on earth, and therefore expansion would spread virtue. Fifth, anti-centralization: Jacksonians argued that adding more states would dilute federal power and preserve states' rights—ironically, this logic appealed to both North and South. Sixth, economic rationalism: $15 million for 525,000 square miles from Mexico was promoted as shrewd business, "the greatest real estate deal in history." Notice how these justifications appealed to different constituencies—moral reformers, racists, democrats, capitalists—creating a broad coalition despite deep disagreements. Estimated time for Slides 4-5: 8 minutes total.

            <!-- Slide 6: Near-Consensus -->
            <section>
                <h2>Near-Consensus, Not Absolute</h2>
                
                <h3>Expansion Backed By…</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Northern Democrats (land for farmers)</li>
                    <li>Southern Democrats (slavery extension)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>But Opposed By…</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wilmot Proviso</strong> → slavery ban attempt</li>
                    <li><strong>Whigs</strong> → feared war & corruption</li>
                    <li><strong>Abolitionists</strong> → moral betrayal</li>
                </ul>
                
                <aside class="notes">
                    So we had a near-consensus, not an absolute one. Northern Democrats supported expansion for land and opportunity. Southern Democrats supported it to extend slavery. But opposition was fierce: the Wilmot Proviso represented Northern Democrats breaking with the South over slavery's future. Whigs feared expansionist wars would corrupt republican virtue and concentrate power in the presidency. Abolitionists saw the whole project as a moral betrayal, a conspiracy to create more slave states. The coalition for expansion was real, but fragile and sectionally divided.

                <h2>III. Stadial Theory</h2>
                
                <h3>Four Stages of Civilization</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Savagery</strong> – hunting, nomadic</li>
                    <li><strong>Barbarism</strong> – pastoral, tribal</li>
                    <li><strong>Agriculture</strong> – settled, land tenure</li>
                    <li><strong>Commerce</strong> – trade, law, republics</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>U.S. in 1840s:</h3>
                <p><strong>Stage 4</strong> → duty to "elevate" continent</p>
                
                <blockquote>"The hunter state can never coexist with the plow" – Sen. Thomas Hart Benton (1846)</blockquote>
                
                <aside class="notes">
                    Here's the intellectual framework that made expansion seem inevitable: stadial theory, borrowed from Scottish Enlightenment thinkers. It divided human societies into four stages: savagery (hunting, nomadic), barbarism (pastoral, tribal), agriculture (settled with land ownership), and commerce (trade, law, republics). Americans saw themselves at Stage 4 and believed they had a duty to "elevate" the continent. Senator Thomas Hart Benton famously declared, "The hunter state can never coexist with the plow." This wasn't just racism; it was a comprehensive theory of historical progress that justified dispossession as civilizational advancement. Native peoples weren't using land "properly," so it could—indeed, must—be taken. Estimated time: 10 minutes.

                <h3>Total Area Added: Over 2 Million Square Miles</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Louisiana Purchase (1803):</strong> $15M, 828K sq mi</li>
                    <li><strong>Texas Annexation (1845):</strong> Joint Resolution, 389K sq mi</li>
                    <li><strong>Oregon Treaty (1846):</strong> Diplomacy with Britain, 286K sq mi</li>
                    <li><strong>Mexican Cession (1848):</strong> $15M treaty, 525K sq mi</li>
                    <li><strong>Gadsden Purchase (1853):</strong> $10M, 30K sq mi</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Total Cost: Approximately $43 Million</strong></p>
                
                <aside class="notes">
                    Let's look at the mechanics. Between 1803 and 1853, the U.S. added over 2 million square miles through five major acquisitions. Louisiana Purchase: $15 million, 828,000 square miles from France in 1803. Texas: annexed by joint resolution of Congress in 1845, 389,000 square miles. Oregon: negotiated with Britain in 1846 at the 49th parallel, 286,000 square miles. Mexican Cession: $15 million via the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, 525,000 square miles including California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona, and parts of New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. Gadsden Purchase: $10 million in 1853, 30,000 square miles for a southern railroad route. Total cost: roughly $43 million. Americans pointed to this and said, "We bought it fair and square." But that's only half the story. Estimated time: 10 minutes.

                    The legal architecture for Native dispossession was established in Johnson v. M'Intosh (1823). Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that Native peoples had a right of occupancy, but not ownership—the U.S. government held the ultimate title and preemptive right to purchase. This meant tribes couldn't sell land to anyone except the federal government, which could then pressure them into unfavorable treaties. Between 1830 and 1850, over 100 million acres were ceded through treaties—often signed under duress, fraud, or outright force. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 led directly to the Trail of Tears. So when we say land was "acquired legally," we need to ask: legal according to whose law? The framework itself was designed to guarantee one outcome.

                    James K. Polk is the most consequential one-term president in American history. Elected in 1844 on an expansionist platform, he achieved four major goals in four years. First, Oregon: he negotiated the 49th parallel with Britain, peacefully securing the Pacific Northwest. Second, Texas: he supported its annexation by joint resolution of Congress—avoiding a treaty that would have required two-thirds Senate approval. Third, California and the Southwest: he provoked and won the Mexican-American War, acquiring half of Mexico's territory. Fourth, economic policy: he lowered tariffs and reestablished the Independent Treasury. His administration embodied the principle: "Wherever the plow went, the courthouse followed"—meaning legal and political structures immediately followed agricultural settlement. Polk was disciplined, ruthless, and extraordinarily effective. Estimated time: 7 minutes.

                <aside class="notes">
                    The Mexican-American War was limited, professional, and decisive. About 100,000 U.S. troops served—mostly volunteers with a core of regular Army professionals. Combat deaths were relatively low: 1,721 in battle, but disease killed 11,000—a reminder that 19th-century wars were often won or lost by logistics and sanitation. Total cost was $97.7 million plus the $15 million paid to Mexico in the treaty. The result: 525,000 square miles via the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. This war has been called a "dress rehearsal for the Civil War" because many officers who fought in Mexico—Grant, Lee, Sherman, Jackson—would face each other again in the 1860s. It also exposed deep sectional tensions: Northern Whigs opposed it as a slaveholders' conspiracy; Southern Democrats celebrated it. Estimated time: 5 minutes.

                <aside class="notes">
                    Expansion triggered a constitutional crisis. The 36°30′ line from the Missouri Compromise of 1820 had kept an uneasy peace by banning slavery north of that latitude in the Louisiana Territory. But the Mexican Cession lay mostly south of that line—would it be slave or free? The Compromise of 1850 tried to resolve this through five provisions: California entered as a free state (breaking the Senate balance), a stronger Fugitive Slave Law was enacted (forcing Northerners to participate in slavery), the slave trade was banned in Washington D.C. (symbolic victory for abolitionists), Utah and New Mexico territories got popular sovereignty (letting settlers vote on slavery), and Texas's boundary was settled with debt relief. This compromise delayed the Civil War by about ten years, but it guaranteed eventual conflict by making slavery a matter of democratic contestation in every new territory. The Missouri Compromise had drawn a line; the Compromise of 1850 erased it. Estimated time: 7 minutes.

                <aside class="notes">
                    So let's take stock. Between 1783 and 1853, the United States transformed from an Atlantic republic into a continental federation. The tools of transformation were treaties, plows, and ballots—legal instruments, agricultural settlement, and democratic (for white men) political institutions. From one perspective, this was an extraordinary achievement: a peaceful acquisition of territory through negotiation and purchase, settlers spreading republican government westward. But here's the final judgment: expansion was territorially successful but politically unsustainable. The addition of so much new territory without a clear resolution of slavery's status made the Civil War nearly inevitable. Every new state and territory became a battleground. The very success of expansion guaranteed the failure of the Union—at least temporarily. The question wasn't whether conflict would come, but when.

                <aside class="notes">
                    Let's close with a visual summary. John Gast's 1872 painting "American Progress" is the canonical image of Manifest Destiny. Columbia, a feminine personification of America, floats westward bringing light—Stage 4 civilization. In her wake come settlers, plows, railroads, and telegraph lines. Ahead of her, darkness retreats: Native peoples and bison flee into shadow. This painting was created after the fact, but it perfectly captures how Americans understood expansion—as enlightenment overcoming darkness, progress replacing primitiveness. Notice what's absent: violence, coercion, treaties signed under duress. The painting presents expansion as a real estate transaction blessed by Providence and justified by the Doctrine of Discovery. It's aspirational mythology, not historical documentation—but it reveals how a society chose to remember itself.

                <h3>Questions?</h3>
                
                <aside class="notes">
                    To conclude: American expansion in the 1840s was legal (within its own framework), replicable (could be repeated across the continent), and demographically driven (by real population pressure). It was also ideologically justified through Manifest Destiny, stadial theory, and racial hierarchy. But the central contradiction—slavery's expansion into new territories—made national unity impossible. The tools that created a continental empire also created the conditions for its temporary dissolution. This is the tragedy of the 1840s: territorial success purchased at the price of political cohesion. Now I'm happy to take your questions.
