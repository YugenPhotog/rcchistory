<h2 style="font-size:3.8em; line-height:1.1;">The War That Didn't End</h2>
<div class="subtitle" style="font-size:2.2em;">Roosevelt and the Moral Mechanics of Occupation</div>
<p style="color:var(--bronze-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:1.8em; margin-top:1.5em;">HIST 102 · Chapter 22 · Lecture 2</p>
<aside class="notes"><h4>📚 What This Lecture Is About</h4>
<p>Lecture 1 showed you how 1898 was made into a spectacle — how media, emotion, and Roosevelt's celebrity turned a war into a political performance. This lecture asks the harder question: <strong>what happened after the curtain came down?</strong> The Treaty of Paris gave the United States the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam. What followed was not a peaceful transition to American benevolence. It was a brutal, grinding counterinsurgency war that lasted years, killed hundreds of thousands, and forced Americans to confront a contradiction they had never fully resolved: can a republic built on consent govern millions of people who never consented?</p>
<h4>⚠️ A Note on the Material</h4>
<p>This lecture covers documented atrocities — torture, civilian massacres, mass starvation as deliberate military strategy. The evidence is in Senate testimony, Army reports, and soldier letters. Treating this history seriously means not softening it. The goal isn't to make you feel bad about America — it's to give you the analytical tools to understand how democracies can do terrible things while genuinely believing they're doing good.</p></aside>

<h2 style="font-size:4.5em;">Today's Questions</h2>
<ul style="font-size:2.0em;">
<li>What did Filipinos expect from American arrival — and why?</li>
<li>What tactics did the U.S. use in the Philippines, and what was their human cost?</li>
<li>How did Americans <em>justify</em> sustained colonial violence — and believe it?</li>
<li>Who said <strong>no</strong> — and what was their argument?</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes"><h4>🗺️ Four Questions, One Argument</h4>
<p>These questions build on each other in a specific order. <strong>What Filipinos expected</strong> establishes that they were not passive recipients of American power — they had their own political vision. <strong>What tactics the U.S. used</strong> establishes the documented record — not editorial, not polemic. <strong>How Americans justified it</strong> asks the harder psychological question: how do people believe they're doing good while doing harm? And <strong>who said no</strong> reminds you that resistance existed — that the record isn't just perpetrators and victims, but critics whose arguments still matter.</p>
<h4>💡 Why This Lecture Is Harder Than Lecture 1</h4>
<p>Lecture 1 was about media and politics — fascinating, somewhat abstract. This lecture is about what those politics produced on the ground: bodies, burned villages, and a war the U.S. government refused to officially call a war. The subject requires directness. The professor won't soften the evidence — and neither should you when you encounter it.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>💭 The Gap Between What America Expected and What It Got</h4>
<p>Americans in December 1898 expected the Treaty of Paris to mean victory, peace, and a quick return home. What they got instead was an unplanned empire — 8 million people in the Philippines alone, none of whom had been consulted about the transfer of sovereignty from Spain to the United States. The Filipinos weren't part of the negotiation. They weren't in the room. The treaty was signed in Paris by two colonial powers, and the Philippines changed hands like a property deed.</p>
<h4>💡 The Sentence That Frames the Whole Lecture</h4>
<p><strong>"Wars do not end when treaties are signed. They end when questions of sovereignty, legitimacy, and consent are resolved."</strong> Hold onto that. The Treaty of Paris ended the Spanish-American War legally. It did not resolve who had the right to govern the Philippines — a question Filipino fighters and the new Philippine Republic had a very clear answer to. The shooting started again by February 1899, six weeks after the treaty was signed.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>📖 Why This Section Comes First</h4>
<p>Before the lecture can tell you what the U.S. did in the Philippines, it needs to establish who was already there. The standard American narrative of 1898 tends to treat the Philippines as a prize won from Spain — passive, waiting, undefined. This section corrects that. By the time American soldiers arrived, the Philippines had an organized independence movement, military forces, political leadership, and a functioning revolutionary government. Understanding that changes everything about what followed.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>🇵🇭 The Philippines Before the U.S. Arrived</h4>
<p>Two years before any American soldier set foot in the Philippines, Filipinos had already launched a revolution. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katipunan" target="_blank"><strong>Katipunan</strong></a> — a secret revolutionary society — began armed revolt against Spain in 1896. This was not a spontaneous uprising. It had newspapers, ideology, a military structure, and mass participation. By June 1898, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Aguinaldo" target="_blank">Emilio Aguinaldo</a> had declared Philippine independence. By January 1899, the Philippines had ratified a constitution and established the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Philippine_Republic" target="_blank">Malolos Republic</a> — with a president, a cabinet, and a legislature.</p>
<h4>⚠️ What This Means</h4>
<p>The people the United States was about to govern had not been consulted — and they had not been sitting still waiting to be governed. They had spent two years fighting for their independence from one colonial power. When the United States arrived presenting itself as a liberator, Aguinaldo had reasonable grounds to expect that liberation meant independence. What he got instead was a new colonial master — and he chose to fight.</p></aside>

<h2 style="font-size:4.5em;">Aguinaldo's Argument</h2>
<div class="primary-source" style="font-size:2.0em;">
        "My government cannot remain indifferent in view of such a violent and aggressive seizure of a portion of its territory by a nation which has arrogated to itself the title of champion of oppressed nations... We are not savages ignorant of how to govern ourselves."
        <div class="primary-source-attribution">— Emilio Aguinaldo, Proclamation, January 1899</div>
</div>
<ul style="font-size:2.0em; margin-top:0.8em;">
<li>This is a <strong>precise political argument</strong> — not a confused response</li>
<li>He was right that the U.S. was replacing one colonial power with another</li>
<li>He was right that Filipinos had the capacity for self-governance</li>
<li>He lost the war anyway</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes"><h4>📖 Read This Carefully — It's a Precise Political Argument</h4>
<p>Aguinaldo's January 1899 proclamation is not the confused protest of someone who doesn't understand what's happening. It is a <strong>specific, accurate, and sophisticated political argument</strong>. He identifies exactly what the U.S. is doing — replacing one colonial power with another — and he calls it what it is: seizure of territory by a nation that claims to champion freedom. The phrase "we are not savages ignorant of how to govern ourselves" is a direct rebuttal to the civilizational justifications that American politicians were already deploying in Congress.</p>
<h4>💡 He Was Right</h4>
<p>Aguinaldo's claim that the U.S. was arrogating to itself the title of "champion of oppressed nations" while oppressing a nation was not propaganda — it was an accurate description of the contradiction at the heart of American imperial policy. Senator Albert Beveridge would stand on the Senate floor that same month and argue that Filipinos were racially unfit for self-government. Aguinaldo's proclamation was a direct answer to that argument — made before Beveridge even delivered it.</p></aside>

<li>Independence would follow Spain's defeat</li>
<li>American officers had implied support</li>
<li>Republic already established</li>
<li>Resistance = <strong>self-determination</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bottom-text-bold" style="font-size:1.8em;">Both sides understood the disagreement perfectly. One side had the power to impose its assumptions.</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>⚠️ This Was Not a Misunderstanding — It Was a Power Struggle</h4>
<p>The slide lists two sets of assumptions — American and Filipino — and it would be easy to read this as a tragic miscommunication, two sides talking past each other. That reading is too comfortable. <strong>Both sides understood the disagreement perfectly.</strong> The Americans knew Filipinos wanted independence. The Filipinos knew the Americans intended to stay. The conflict wasn't caused by confusion — it was caused by one side having the military and economic power to impose its assumptions on the other.</p>
<h4>📌 Notice the Word "Ingratitude"</h4>
<p>The American framing of Filipino resistance as <em>ingratitude</em> is worth sitting with. It assumes that American presence was inherently a gift — that the Filipinos should have been thankful for occupation. That assumption required believing that Filipinos were incapable of governing themselves, that American rule was genuinely benevolent, and that independence was something to be earned rather than a right. Aguinaldo's proclamation directly challenged all three. The "ingratitude" framing was a way of refusing to engage with his argument.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>🤔 A Question Worth Sitting With Honestly</h4>
<p>By January 1899, the Philippines had a constitution, a president, a legislature, and an army. On what grounds did the United States claim authority to govern them? The lecture will surface three common answers students arrive at:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purchase from Spain:</strong> The U.S. paid Spain $20 million for the Philippines — but can sovereignty be bought and sold like property without the consent of the people involved?</li>
<li><strong>Military victory:</strong> American forces defeated the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay — but defeating one colonial power doesn't automatically grant you the right to replace it</li>
<li><strong>"Civilizational" arguments:</strong> Filipinos weren't "ready" for self-rule — but who decides readiness, and what are the criteria?</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these answers is satisfying on its own — and the lecture's job is to show what those justifications actually produced in practice. The question isn't resolved here. Hold it.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>📖 The War That Wasn't Called a War</h4>
<p>Pay attention to the language the U.S. government used: not "war," but "pacification campaign." Not "soldiers," but "insurgents." Not "enemy combatants," but "criminals." That language wasn't accidental — it was doing political work, and this section will show you exactly what work it was doing and why it mattered for what the U.S. military was permitted to do.</p></aside></section>

<li>Filipino response: shift to <strong>guerrilla warfare</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="bottom-text" style="font-size:1.8em;">The language matters. "Insurgents" are criminals. Soldiers are combatants. The word choice determined how violence was permitted to proceed.</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>💥 How the War Started</h4>
<p>On the night of February 4, 1899, American sentries shot two Filipino soldiers near Manila. Within hours, fighting had spread across the city. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine%E2%80%93American_War" target="_blank">Philippine-American War</a> had begun — though the U.S. government refused to call it that for over a century. Officially, it was a "pacification campaign" against "insurgents." That word choice had real legal and moral consequences: soldiers are covered by the laws of war; insurgents and criminals are not.</p>
<h4>📌 Why the Language Mattered</h4>
<p>Calling Filipino fighters "insurgents" rather than soldiers accomplished several things at once. It delegitimized the Philippine Republic and its constitution. It framed armed resistance to occupation as criminality rather than self-defense. It removed Filipino fighters from the protections of the laws of war. And it made the conflict sound like a policing problem rather than a war — smaller, more manageable, and less morally fraught than it actually was. The language was doing the work that justification couldn't do directly.</p>
<h4>💡 The Military Logic That Followed</h4>
<p>Filipino conventional forces lost quickly — American industrial firepower overwhelmed set-piece resistance by mid-1899. The Filipino response was to shift to guerrilla warfare, which was militarily rational given the power imbalance. That shift then triggered a specific American counterinsurgency logic — one whose conclusions the next slides document in full.</p></aside>
</section>
<!-- SLIDE: Guerrilla Logic -->
<section>
<h2 style="font-size:4.0em;">The Logic of Counterinsurgency</h2>
<div class="callout" style="font-size:2.0em;">
<strong>The problem:</strong> When conventional resistance fails, guerrilla fighters rely on civilian support — food, shelter, intelligence.
    </div>
<ul style="font-size:2.0em; margin-top:0.8em;">
<li>You cannot defeat guerrillas without <strong>separating them from the civilian population</strong></li>
<li>That separation requires controlling civilians</li>
<li>Controlling civilians at scale requires coercion</li>
<li>This logic is <em>militarily rational</em></li>
<li>It is also <em>humanly catastrophic</em></li>
</ul>
<div class="bottom-text-bold" style="font-size:1.8em;">The tactics that follow are not aberrations. They are the conclusions of this logic.</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>⚙️ Follow the Logic — It Leads Somewhere Specific</h4>
<p>This slide asks you to follow a chain of military reasoning that is, in its own terms, coherent. Guerrilla fighters depend on civilian support — food, shelter, intelligence. You cannot defeat them by killing fighters alone, because fighters blend back into the civilian population. Therefore, to defeat the guerrillas, you must separate them from civilians. Separating fighters from civilians at the scale of an entire archipelago requires controlling where civilians live, what they eat, and who they talk to. Controlling civilians at scale requires coercion. <strong>This logic is militarily rational. It is also humanly catastrophic.</strong></p>
<h4>⚠️ The Crucial Point</h4>
<p>The tactics that follow in this lecture — reconcentration camps, food destruction, village burning — are not aberrations by rogue soldiers. They are the conclusions of this logic, applied systematically. Understanding that is not the same as excusing it. It means that moral responsibility doesn't rest only with the soldiers who carried out the tactics. It rests with the commanders who ordered them, the officials who approved them, and the politicians who funded a war whose logic made them inevitable.</p></aside>

</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>💭 What This Exercise Is For</h4>
<p>Before the lecture shows you what the U.S. actually did, it's asking you to reason toward it yourself. If guerrilla fighters depend on civilian support, and you need to eliminate that support, what are your options? Think through it honestly. You'll likely arrive at some version of: move civilians into controlled zones, cut off food supplies to areas where fighters operate, make it costly for civilians to cooperate with fighters. <strong>You've just described reconcentration camps and deliberate famine as military strategy.</strong></p>
<p>That's not an accident. The exercise is designed to show you that these tactics weren't invented by uniquely evil men — they were the conclusions that rational military planners reached when given a specific problem. That makes them more disturbing, not less. Evil that follows a logic is harder to prevent than evil that comes from individual wickedness.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>📊 Numbers That Require Attention</h4>
<p>200,000 to 700,000 Filipino civilian deaths. That range is wide because the historical record is incomplete — the U.S. military did not keep careful count of civilian deaths, which is itself a form of evidence about how the war was being conducted. For comparison: approximately 4,200 American military personnel died, mostly in combat. The asymmetry is not incidental. It reflects the difference between an organized army with industrial firepower and a civilian population caught between guerrilla fighters and counterinsurgency operations.</p>
<h4>⚠️ Why Most Deaths Were Civilian</h4>
<p>The majority of Filipino deaths came not from battlefield combat but from <strong>famine and disease deliberately caused by U.S. military strategy</strong> — the destruction of food supplies, the burning of crops and livestock, the forced relocation of civilians into reconcentration zones where disease spread rapidly. This was not collateral damage in the ordinary sense. It was a predictable and predicted consequence of tactics that military commanders knew would cause mass civilian suffering. The numbers are the evidence that the strategy worked as designed.</p>
<h4>🎓 Historians Weigh In</h4>

The thresholds for acceptable violence were set differently for Filipino civilians than they would have been for white European civilians, and that difference was explicit in military communications.</p></aside>

<h4>⚠️ The Cuba Comparison — Read This Carefully</h4>
<p>In 1897–98, American newspapers ran front-page outrage about Spanish <em>reconcentration camps</em> in Cuba — General Weyler's policy of forcing Cuban civilians into controlled zones, where they died of disease and starvation by the tens of thousands. That outrage was one of the primary drivers of American intervention in Cuba. By 1901, the U.S. Army was running reconcentration camps in the Philippines using the same logic and producing the same results. <strong>Same word. Same practice. Same consequences. Three years later.</strong> The hypocrisy is not subtle, and it was documented in real time by American critics — who are covered in Section V.</p></aside>

</ul>
<aside class="notes"><h4>⚠️ What It Was — Described Plainly</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cure_(torture)" target="_blank">water cure</a> was a torture technique used systematically in the Philippines. Interrogators forced water — sometimes contaminated — into a prisoner's mouth and stomach through repeated pouring until the abdomen visibly distended. Then they compressed or beat the abdomen to expel it. Then repeated. Until the prisoner talked, lost consciousness, or died. This is not a disputed description — it comes from the soldiers who administered it, testifying under oath before the United States Senate.</p>
<h4>📌 Why "Not a Rogue Practice" Matters</h4>
<p>The water cure was widespread enough to generate Senate hearings, press coverage, and official military investigations. Soldiers who testified described it matter-of-factly — some defended it as effective. Officers who knew about it and failed to stop it received mild or no punishment. This is the evidence that the water cure was not the aberration of a few bad actors. It was a practice the institution knew about, tolerated, and in many cases implicitly authorized. When a practice is widespread, documented, and produces no serious institutional consequences, it is institutionally sanctioned — whatever the official policy says.</p></aside>

<p>The Senate testimony quoted here was heard by United States senators in 1902. They heard soldiers describe, under oath, in plain language, exactly what the water cure involved. <strong>The war continued.</strong> That three-word sentence at the bottom of the slide is doing a lot of work. It tells you that the decision to continue the war was made with full knowledge of what was happening. Not ignorance. Not a failure of information. Knowledge — followed by a choice to continue.</p>
<h4>💡 What This Means for Moral Responsibility</h4>
<p>This is the slide that makes the "few bad apples" explanation impossible. Bad apple arguments require that the institution didn't know, couldn't have stopped it, or moved swiftly to correct it when it did know. The Senate hearings are evidence that the institution knew. The continuation of the war is evidence that knowledge did not produce correction. The gap between what was known and what was done is itself a moral and historical fact — one that this lecture asks you to sit with rather than resolve too quickly.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>💥 A Specific Anchor in the Record</h4>
<p>On September 28, 1901, Filipino fighters carried out a surprise attack on American soldiers eating breakfast at Balangiga — killing 48, the deadliest Filipino attack of the war. The U.S. military response came from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_H._Smith" target="_blank">General Jacob Smith</a>, whose orders are in the historical record verbatim: <em>"I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn. The more you kill and burn, the better you will please me."</em> He defined "capable of bearing arms" as males over ten years old.</p>
<h4>⚠️ What Those Orders Mean</h4>
<p>Smith's orders were not a threat or a figure of speech. They were operational instructions that were carried out. The interior of Samar was systematically devastated — villages burned, population killed or displaced, the island described in military reports as a "howling wilderness." Smith was subsequently court-martialed — but his punishment was a mild reprimand and forced retirement with full honors. The next slide asks you to think carefully about what that gap between offense and punishment reveals.</p></aside>
</section>
<!-- SLIDE: The Gap -->
<section>
<h2 style="font-size:4.5em;">The Gap Between Offense and Punishment</h2>
<div class="gap-bridge">
<div class="gap-left">"Kill everyone over ten"<br/><span style="font-size:0.7em;">+ systematic devastation of Samar</span></div>
<div class="gap-arrow">→</div>

</div>
<div class="callout" style="font-size:2.0em; margin-top:1em;">
        That gap <em>is itself evidence.</em> The system that produced Smith did not treat what he did as a fundamental violation. It treated it as an <strong>excess of zeal.</strong>
</div>
<ul style="font-size:2.0em; margin-top:0.8em;">
<li>Institutional tolerance for colonial violence was <strong>structural</strong>, not incidental</li>
<li>The punishment tells you where the lines actually were</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes"><h4>⚖️ Read the Punishment as Evidence</h4>
<p>"Kill everyone over ten" — systematic devastation of an entire island — mild reprimand and full-honors retirement. <strong>That gap is itself evidence about where the institutional lines actually were.</strong> Smith was court-martialed, which means the system formally acknowledged that he had violated some standard. But the punishment tells you that what he violated was a standard of proportionality or optics — not a fundamental prohibition. The system treated what he did as an excess of zeal, not as a crime.</p>
<h4>💡 Structural vs. Individual Responsibility</h4>
<p>This is where the analysis gets harder. Smith is easy to condemn as an individual. The more important question is what institutional conditions made his orders possible — and what the mild punishment reveals about those conditions. An institution that court-martials an officer for saying "kill everyone over ten" but then retires him with full honors has told you something very specific about what it actually tolerates. The punishment is not the end of the analysis. It's the beginning of it.</p></aside>

    </div>
<div class="bottom-text" style="font-size:1.8em;">Understanding context is not the same as excusing. It's the same move we made with yellow journalism: you can't explain a phenomenon without understanding its conditions.</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>📖 Why This Slide Is Here</h4>
<p>Filipino forces committed documented atrocities against American prisoners — torture, mutilation, execution of captives. This slide includes that record because leaving it out would be dishonest, and because the analytical frame for understanding it is important: <strong>colonial wars brutalize everyone they touch.</strong> Not equally — the scale and systematic nature of American violence was far greater than Filipino violence — but the dehumanization that makes atrocity possible spreads through a conflict in both directions.</p>
<h4>💡 Understanding Context Is Not Excusing</h4>
<p>Explaining why atrocities occurred on both sides — the desperation of a resistance movement facing industrial firepower and collective punishment, the rage that follows watching your village burned — is not the same as excusing them. It is, in fact, the only way to understand them honestly. A history that condemns only one side's atrocities and ignores the other's is propaganda, not scholarship. A history that treats all atrocities as equivalent regardless of scale and context is also dishonest. The analytical goal is precision: what happened, why, at what scale, and with what institutional consequences.</p></aside>

</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>🤔 The Hypocrisy Is Exact — That's What Makes It Worth Analyzing</h4>
<p>The United States condemned Spain for reconcentration in Cuba in 1897–98. American newspapers ran front-page outrage. That outrage helped drive the country into war. Three years later, the U.S. Army was running reconcentration camps in the Philippines using the same tactic, producing the same mass civilian deaths. <strong>Same word. Same practice. Same consequences.</strong></p>
<p>The question isn't just "isn't that hypocritical?" — of course it is. The interesting question is: <em>what mechanism allows people to see the same practice as an atrocity when the enemy does it and a military necessity when we do it?</em> The answer the lecture is building toward involves racial ideology — the dehumanizing logic that sets different thresholds for acceptable violence against different people. When Filipinos are "insurgents" rather than soldiers, when they are "not yet ready for self-government," the same tactics that were outrageous against Cubans become administratively normal. That's the mechanism worth articulating.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>📌 Two Ways of Saying the Same Thing</h4>
<p>A soldier testifies under oath: <em>"We burned it."</em> An official Army report reads: <em>"Pacification operations completed in the district of Batangas."</em> The same event. The same actions. Two completely different moral worlds. "Pacification" is a word that makes violence sound administrative — a technical process with a benevolent goal. It removes the fire, the people running, the village that no longer exists. It places the burden of causation on the people being "pacified" — implying that the violence was made necessary by their failure to cooperate.</p>
<h4>💡 Language as a Tool of Power</h4>
<p>When a government can describe the destruction of a civilian population as "pacification," language has become a tool of power. This is not unique to the Philippines or to 1901. Official language in every imperial context performs this function — making violence invisible, making coercion sound benevolent, and making resistance sound like the real problem. Learning to read official language critically — to ask what it's concealing and what work it's doing — is one of the most durable skills this lecture can give you.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>📖 Beveridge Believed What He Said</h4>
<p>Senator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Beveridge" target="_blank">Albert Beveridge's</a> 1900 Senate speech is worth reading in full — it's one of the most articulate expressions of American imperial ideology ever put into the congressional record. He believed in both democracy and civilizational hierarchy simultaneously. He was not lying about his convictions. He genuinely thought that American expansion was a divine mission, that Filipinos were not yet capable of self-government, and that American rule — however coercive — was ultimately in Filipino interests. <strong>Empire was not cynical cover. It was genuine moral conviction.</strong></p>
<h4>⚠️ Why Genuine Belief Is Not a Defense</h4>
<p>The sincerity of Beveridge's belief doesn't make it less dangerous — it makes it more so. Cynical operators who know they're doing wrong can be shamed into stopping. True believers cannot. And Beveridge was not alone: many American Progressives — people who supported labor rights, regulation of corporations, conservation — also supported the Philippine occupation. The same moral framework that told them government should improve people's lives also told them that some people weren't yet capable of improving their own. <strong>Progressive imperialism is not a contradiction. It is a coherent worldview with horrifying consequences.</strong></p>
<h4>🖼️ Look at the "School Begins" Cartoon</h4>
<p>The 1899 <em>Puck</em> cartoon "School Begins" depicts Uncle Sam as a schoolteacher with new pupils — the Philippines, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii — represented as children of color, while white children (representing existing states) sit at their desks looking on. Native Americans and Chinese students sit in the back. The cartoon was published approvingly. It captures the civilizational hierarchy that animated American imperial ideology — the assumption that some peoples were children who needed to be taught, and that the United States had both the right and the duty to teach them.</p></aside>

</ul>
<aside class="notes"><h4>🔗 One System, Two Theaters</h4>
<p>This is one of the most important analytical points in the lecture: the racial language used to justify governing Filipinos — "children," "not ready for self-government," requiring firm guidance — was not invented for the Philippines. It was borrowed directly from the domestic language used to justify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws" target="_blank">Jim Crow</a>. The same framework that told white Americans that Black citizens needed to be supervised, disenfranchised, and denied full civil participation also told them that Filipinos needed to be governed rather than liberated. <strong>The overseas color line and the domestic color line were not separate systems. They were the same system deployed in two different places.</strong></p>
<h4>💡 The Practical Consequence</h4>
<p>Racial hierarchy did something specific and measurable in the Philippines: it lowered the threshold for acceptable violence. Different rules applied to people constructed as "not fully civilized." This is why Jacob Smith's orders could be issued, carried out, and met with a mild reprimand. And it's why Black American critics of the war — covered in Section V — saw the connection so clearly: they were living under one version of the same logic that was being applied to Filipinos. The overseas and domestic systems were not analogous. They were continuous.</p></aside>

<p>Roosevelt's framework has no limiting principle. "Not yet ready for self-government" can always be extended. The timeline for when coercion becomes liberty can always be pushed forward. And the occupying power — which benefits from the occupation — is simultaneously the judge of when the occupation has achieved its stated purpose. The Canal Zone, acquired in 1903 under Roosevelt, ran until 1999. "Temporary" in imperial logic tends to mean "as long as we find it useful." The anti-imperialists understood this. That's why they called it what it was.</p></aside>

<h4>💡 The Case for C or D</h4>
<p>Individual bad actors — cynics and true believers alike — can be identified, removed, prosecuted. The more durable problem is the institution that normalizes both: that accepts "pacification" as a description of mass violence, that retires Jacob Smith with full honors, that continues a war after Senate testimony about torture. Institutional normalization doesn't require individual bad intent. It just requires that the institution's incentives, language, and procedures make certain questions hard to ask. And citizens who don't ask — who consume the official language without interrogating it — are the condition under which institutional normalization persists. That's the question this lecture is really asking: what allows democratic citizens to fund and support a colonial war while believing they're doing good?</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>📋 Who Said No</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Imperialist_League" target="_blank">Anti-Imperialist League</a>, founded in 1898, was ideologically diverse in ways that are worth noting. <strong>Mark Twain</strong> was a satirist who attacked imperial ideology with devastating precision. <strong>Andrew Carnegie</strong> was one of the richest men in America and offered to personally buy the Philippines its independence. <strong>Grover Cleveland</strong> was a former president who found empire incompatible with republican principles. <strong>Booker T. Washington</strong> and <strong>Ida B. Wells</strong> — from very different positions within Black American politics — both opposed the war for reasons rooted in the connection between overseas racial hierarchy and domestic Jim Crow.</p>
<h4>💡 The Core Argument</h4>
<p>The anti-imperialists' central claim was not simply that the war was brutal — though it was. Their argument was constitutional and philosophical: <strong>governing without consent corrupts the democracy doing the governing, not just the people being governed.</strong> Empire requires practices — arbitrary detention, military tribunals, denial of civil liberties — that are incompatible with republican self-government. You cannot maintain those practices abroad indefinitely without them migrating home. That argument was not resolved in 1902. It is still being made.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>🔗 The Argument Only They Could Make Fully</h4>
<p>Black American critics of the Philippine War had a specific and uniquely powerful argument: they were living under the same racial logic being applied to Filipinos. The claim that Filipinos were "not ready for self-government" and required American supervision was the same claim used to justify disenfranchisement, segregation, and violence against Black Americans at home. <strong>You cannot deploy racial hierarchy abroad while claiming to dismantle it at home. The two projects are incompatible.</strong></p>
<h4>👤 David Fagen and the Limits of Loyalty</h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fagen" target="_blank">David Fagen</a> — a Black corporal in the 24th Infantry — crossed over to fight with Aguinaldo's forces in 1899 and continued fighting for nearly two years. His decision was not random. Black soldiers in the Philippines had been ordered to enforce on Filipinos the same racial subordination they were subjected to at home. Some refused. Fagen's defection was the most dramatic expression of a recognition many Black soldiers shared: that the color line being drawn in the Philippines and the color line being drawn in the American South were the same line, drawn by the same hand, for the same reasons.</p>

        Twain is not exaggerating for effect. He is <strong>summarizing the record.</strong> That is what makes it devastating.
    </div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>✍️ How Satire Works as Historical Evidence</h4>
<p>Mark Twain's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_Person_Sitting_in_Darkness" target="_blank">"To the Person Sitting in Darkness"</a> (1901) is one of the most effective pieces of anti-imperial writing in American history — and understanding why it works helps you understand what made imperial ideology so vulnerable to this kind of attack. Twain doesn't argue against empire in the abstract. He takes the official language of "Benevolent Assimilation" completely seriously and applies it directly to what was actually happening. The result is devastating because <strong>Twain is not exaggerating. He is summarizing the documented record.</strong></p>
<h4>💡 What Makes It Devastating</h4>
<p>The passage on the slide — "we have pacified some thousands of the islanders and buried them" — works because every word in it is defensible. The islands were being "pacified." People were being buried. The word "benevolent assimilation" was Roosevelt's own phrase. Twain's technique is to put the official language next to what it was describing, and let the gap do the work. When "Benevolent Assimilation" means burning villages and killing people who bear arms — and "capable of bearing arms" means males over ten — the language has become its own indictment. Read the full essay if you want to see this technique extended across fifteen pages.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>🤔 The Anti-Imperialists' Deepest Claim</h4>
<p>The anti-imperialists argued something more specific than "the war is wrong." They argued that <strong>governing without consent corrupts the democracy doing the governing</strong> — that empire doesn't just harm the occupied population, it deforms the occupying democracy. The practices required to maintain colonial rule — military tribunals, suspension of civil liberties, systematic torture, denial of political rights — are incompatible with republican self-government. Import them into the imperial project and you create institutional habits, legal precedents, and political cultures that don't stay neatly overseas.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: does the evidence from this lecture support that argument? The water cure. The Senate hearings that produced no serious consequences. Jacob Smith's full-honors retirement. The official language that made mass violence sound administrative. Is there evidence that the practices of colonial governance were corrupting democratic institutions at home — or is that too strong a claim? What would you need to see to decide?</p></aside>

<p>These are not rhetorical questions designed to produce predetermined answers. They are the actual political and moral questions the United States confronted in 1899 — and they are still live questions today.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can liberty be postponed?</strong> If so, who has the authority to postpone it — and on what grounds? Note that the people whose liberty is being postponed are never the ones deciding.</li>
<li><strong>Who decides when order is sufficient for freedom to begin?</strong> In every case of liberal imperialism, the answer has been: the occupying power. That is a structural problem, not an individual one.</li>
<li><strong>How long does "temporary" rule usually last?</strong> The Canal Zone: 1903–1999. The Philippines: formal independence not until 1946. "Temporary" in imperial logic is an elastic concept.</li>
<li><strong>Where does individual moral responsibility end and structural responsibility begin?</strong> This is the hardest question. Individual soldiers carried out torture. Individual commanders issued orders. Individual senators heard testimony and continued funding the war. At what point does the structure — the institution, the ideology, the democratic citizenry — become the responsible party?</li>

<li>Democratic states can practice colonial rule while <strong>genuinely believing</strong> they are doing good</li>

<aside class="notes"><h4>🔭 Five Things This War Teaches</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Empire requires sustained coercion at scale.</strong> There is no version of governing without consent that doesn't eventually require force — and force at the scale of an archipelago of 8 million people is not a brief intervention. It is a commitment.</li>
<li><strong>Moral language does not eliminate violence — it makes violence administratively normal.</strong> "Pacification" doesn't reduce the burning. It makes the burning easier to fund and authorize.</li>
<li><strong>Democratic states can practice colonial rule while genuinely believing they are doing good.</strong> Beveridge was sincere. Roosevelt was sincere. That sincerity was not a defense — it was a mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Colonial wars brutalize all participants.</strong> Not equally — the occupied suffer far more than the occupiers — but the dehumanization is structural and spreads through the conflict in both directions.</li>
<li><strong>Wars for liberation can become wars for control without anyone formally deciding to change course.</strong> The slide from "freeing Cuba" to "governing the Philippines" happened through a series of decisions that each seemed locally reasonable but added up to something none of their architects had explicitly chosen.</li>

<aside class="notes"><h4>🔭 The Connection to What Comes Next</h4>
<p>Lecture 3 turns to Roosevelt as president — and the question it's going to ask is whether the same man who ordered the Philippines "pacified" and presided over the documented record of this lecture is also the man who busted the trusts, created the national parks, and pushed the regulatory state into existence. The answer is yes — and understanding how those two things coexist in the same person and the same presidency is one of the central challenges of Progressive Era history.</p>
<h4>💡 The Through-Line</h4>
<p>The connection between imperial and domestic Progressivism isn't accidental. Both rest on the same foundational assumption: that expert, energetic government intervention — guided by people who know what's right — can improve society for everyone, whether or not everyone consents. The Philippines was the laboratory. The regulatory state was the experiment running simultaneously at home. Roosevelt's presidency is where those two projects met — and the friction between them reveals something important about what Progressivism was and what it could not fully see about itself.</p></aside>

</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>✏️ How to Do This Comparison Well</h4>
<p>This extension exercise gives you two descriptions of the same operations in Batangas: an official Army report and Senate testimony from soldiers who were there. The exercise is asking you to read them as a historian — not just to note that they're different, but to identify <strong>the specific word choices and framing decisions that make the Army report able to describe what the testimony describes without triggering the same moral response.</strong></p>
<h4>📌 What to Look For</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agency:</strong> Who is acting in each document? The Army report will have passive constructions; the testimony will have soldiers doing things</li>
<li><strong>Victims:</strong> Does the Army report acknowledge civilian deaths? How are they described if so?</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What goal does each document construct for the operations?</li>
<li><strong>Evaluative language:</strong> Where does the Army report use neutral or positive language for actions the testimony describes as violent?</li>
</ul>
<p>The question — "what would you need to believe to vote against investigating further?" — is asking you to reconstruct the cognitive and moral framework that made the official language persuasive. That's a sophisticated historical skill: not just identifying that language conceals, but understanding how and why it succeeds in concealing.

A secret Filipino revolutionary organization founded in Manila in 1892 that launched armed revolt against Spanish colonial rule in 1896. Led by Andrés Bonifacio and later associated with Emilio Aguinaldo, the Katipunan represented the organizational backbone of the Philippine independence movement and predated any American involvement by years.

The constitution provided for a unicameral legislature, separation of church and state, and civil liberties. Emilio Aguinaldo served as president. The republic had functioning governmental institutions before the Philippine-American War began. Its existence is historically significant because it demonstrates that the American argument — that Filipinos were "not ready for self-government" — was refuted by events before the war started.

<p>A counterinsurgency tactic used by U.S. forces in the Philippines — particularly in Batangas and Samar — in which the civilian population of a region was forcibly relocated into controlled zones, leaving the surrounding area subject to systematic destruction. Food supplies, crops, and livestock outside the zones were destroyed to deny resources to guerrilla fighters. The tactic caused massive civilian deaths from disease and starvation in the camps. The United States had used Spanish General Weyler's identical reconcentration policy in Cuba as a major justification for the Spanish-American War in 1898 — branding it the work of a "butcher." The American use of reconcentration in the Philippines just three years later is one of the clearest documented examples of the gap between imperial rhetoric and imperial practice.</p>

<div class="definition-term">Water Cure</div>
<p>A torture technique used by U.S. forces during the Philippine-American War to extract information from prisoners. The procedure involved forcing large quantities of water — sometimes contaminated — into a restrained prisoner's mouth and throat until the abdomen distended, then applying compression or beating to expel the water, and repeating the process. It was not a rogue practice: it was widespread enough to generate Senate hearings in 1902, extensive press coverage, and official military investigations. Soldiers who testified about it in Senate hearings described it matter-of-factly, and some defended it as effective. The officers who ordered it generally received minimal or no punishment. The Senate hearings produced a public record but resulted in no systematic accountability.</p>

<p>On September 28, 1901, Filipino fighters launched a coordinated surprise attack on Company C of the U.S. 9th Infantry at Balangiga on the island of Samar, killing 48 American soldiers — the deadliest Filipino attack of the war. The American response, ordered by General Jacob Smith, was the systematic devastation of Samar's interior. Smith's documented orders specified killing all males over age ten, leaving no prisoners, and turning Samar into a "howling wilderness." The campaign killed an undetermined number of civilians through direct violence, displacement, and starvation. Smith was court-martialed, received a mild reprimand, and was allowed to retire with full honors. The three church bells from Balangiga were taken as war trophies and held by the U.S. Army for over a century; they were returned to the Philippines in 2018 after decades of Filipino requests.</p>

<div class="popup" id="libimperialism-popup">

<div class="definition-term">Liberal Imperialism</div>
<p>A framework for justifying colonial rule that argues coercion in the short term serves freedom in the long term — with the imperial power alone deciding when conditions are sufficient for self-governance to begin. Associated with Roosevelt's public defense of Philippine occupation: liberty requires order; order requires force; force in service of eventual freedom is regrettable but necessary. Critics identified the framework's fatal flaw immediately: it has no internal limiting principle. The timeline for "eventual freedom" can always be extended; the threshold for "readiness" can always be raised. In practice, "temporary" imperial rule routinely became permanent. The U.S. administered the Panama Canal Zone from 1903 to 1999 — 96 years — under frameworks descended from this logic.</p>
