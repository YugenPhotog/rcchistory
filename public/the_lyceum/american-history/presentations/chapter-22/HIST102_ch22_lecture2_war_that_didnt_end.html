<h2 style="font-size:3.8em; line-height:1.1;">The War That Didn't End</h2>
<div class="subtitle" style="font-size:2.2em;">Roosevelt and the Moral Mechanics of Occupation</div>
<p style="color:var(--bronze-accent); font-style:italic; font-size:1.8em; margin-top:1.5em;">HIST 102 · Chapter 22 · Lecture 2</p>
<aside class="notes"><h4>📚 What This Lecture Is About</h4>
<p>Lecture 1 showed you how 1898 was made into a spectacle — how media, emotion, and Roosevelt's celebrity turned a war into a political performance. This lecture asks the harder question: <strong>what happened after the curtain came down?</strong> The Treaty of Paris gave the United States the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam. What followed was not a peaceful transition to American benevolence. It was a brutal, grinding counterinsurgency war that lasted years, killed hundreds of thousands, and forced Americans to confront a contradiction they had never fully resolved: can a republic built on consent govern millions of people who never consented?</p>
<h4>⚠️ A Note on the Material</h4>
<p>This lecture covers documented atrocities — torture, civilian massacres, mass starvation as deliberate military strategy. The evidence is in Senate testimony, Army reports, and soldier letters. Treating this history seriously means not softening it. The goal isn't to make you feel bad about America — it's to give you the analytical tools to understand how democracies can do terrible things while genuinely believing they're doing good.</p></aside>

<section>
<h2 style="font-size:4.5em;">Today's Questions</h2>
<ul style="font-size:2.0em;">
<li>What did Filipinos expect from American arrival — and why?</li>
<li>What tactics did the U.S. use in the Philippines, and what was their human cost?</li>
<li>How did Americans <em>justify</em> sustained colonial violence — and believe it?</li>
<li>Who said <strong>no</strong> — and what was their argument?</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes"><h4>🗺️ Four Questions, One Argument</h4>
<p>These questions build on each other in a specific order. <strong>What Filipinos expected</strong> establishes that they were not passive recipients of American power — they had their own political vision. <strong>What tactics the U.S. used</strong> establishes the documented record — not editorial, not polemic. <strong>How Americans justified it</strong> asks the harder psychological question: how do people believe they're doing good while doing harm? And <strong>who said no</strong> reminds you that resistance existed — that the record isn't just perpetrators and victims, but critics whose arguments still matter.</p>
<h4>💡 Why This Lecture Is Harder Than Lecture 1</h4>
<p>Lecture 1 was about media and politics — fascinating, somewhat abstract. This lecture is about what those politics produced on the ground: bodies, burned villages, and a war the U.S. government refused to officially call a war. The subject requires directness. The professor won't soften the evidence — and neither should you when you encounter it.</p></aside>

<h3 style="font-size:2.2em; color:var(--deep-teal); margin-bottom:0.6em;">The Treaty That Made America an Empire Overnight</h3>
<div class="two-column">
<div>
<div class="column-header" style="font-size:2.0em;">What the Treaty Said</div>
<ul style="font-size:1.9em;">
<li>Spain surrenders <strong>Cuba</strong> — U.S. takes temporary control</li>
<li>Spain cedes <strong>Puerto Rico</strong> and <strong>Guam</strong> to the United States</li>
<li>Spain cedes the <strong>Philippine Islands</strong> to the United States</li>
<li>The U.S. pays Spain <strong>$20 million</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="callout" style="font-size:1.7em; margin-top:0.8em;">
Signed in Paris. <em>No Filipino was in the room.</em>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div class="column-header" style="font-size:2.0em;">What the Treaty Did</div>
<ul style="font-size:1.9em;">
<li>Transferred sovereignty over <strong>8 million Filipinos</strong> from one empire to another</li>
<li>Extinguished the Philippine Republic that Aguinaldo had declared in <strong>June 1898</strong></li>
<li>Transformed the United States from a continental republic into a <strong>Pacific colonial power</strong></li>
<li>Created a legal fact — but not a political one</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>📜 Why This Slide Has to Exist</h4>
<p>Students watched a documentary on the Spanish-American War. They know the U.S. defeated Spain. But the documentary almost certainly ended there — with the victory, the celebration, Roosevelt's charge. What it didn't explain is the specific legal mechanism by which the United States became a colonial empire in one afternoon. This slide is that mechanism.</p>
<h4>💡 The Four Terms That Matter</h4>
<p>Walk through each term carefully:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cuba:</strong> The U.S. did <em>not</em> annex Cuba outright — it took "temporary" control, later formalized through the Platt Amendment. Cubans got nominal independence with American veto power built into their constitution. That's the partial version of empire.</li>
<li><strong>Puerto Rico and Guam:</strong> Straightforward cession — no purchase price, no negotiation. Spain simply gave them up as war indemnity.</li>
<li><strong>The Philippines:</strong> The most contested. McKinley paid Spain $20 million — not to the Filipinos who lived there, but to Spain, which had just spent three years failing to suppress a Filipino independence revolt. The U.S. was purchasing sovereignty over people who had already declared that sovereignty wasn't Spain's to sell.</li>
</ul>
<h4>⚡ The Phrase That Should Land</h4>
<p>"Signed in Paris. No Filipino was in the room." Don't rush past that. Spain and the United States negotiated the fate of 8 million people as a bilateral transaction. Filipino leaders were not observers, not consulted, not notified in advance. Aguinaldo learned the terms from newspaper reports. That's the original wound. Everything in this lecture follows from it.</p>
<h4>🔗 The Conceptual Bridge</h4>
<p>The title of this lecture is <em>The War That Didn't End</em>. This slide is why. The Treaty of Paris ended the legal state of war between the United States and Spain. It did not end the Philippine Revolution — it just redirected it. The Filipinos had been fighting for independence from Spain since 1896. They were still fighting. The treaty simply changed who they were fighting against.</p>
<h4>🤔 Discussion Prompt</h4>
<p>Ask students: "The United States went to war in 1898 partly to free Cuba from Spanish colonialism. What does it mean that the peace treaty required the U.S. to become a colonial power itself?" Give them 60 seconds to think before moving on.</p></aside>

  </ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout" style="font-size:1.9em; margin-top:0.8em;">
  The Spanish-American War lasted 109 days. <strong>The war it produced lasted a generation.</strong>
</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>📖 Why "Insurrection" and Not "War"</h4>
<p>The naming decision was deliberate and consequential. Calling it an "insurrection" rather than a war accomplished several things simultaneously: it denied the Philippine Republic legal standing as a belligerent nation, framed Filipino fighters as criminals rather than soldiers, and allowed the U.S. government to avoid the legal and diplomatic obligations that a declared war would have triggered. Students already know from the previous slides how official language functions as a tool of power — this is that same mechanism operating at the level of the conflict's name. The word "insurrection" did political work from the moment it was chosen.</p>

<h4>📊 The Civilian Death Range — Why It's a Range</h4>
<p>The 200,000–600,000 figure is deliberately presented as a range because historians genuinely dispute it. The lower estimates come from direct combat and documented famine deaths; the higher estimates incorporate excess mortality from disease, displacement, and the destruction of the agricultural economy — particularly in Batangas and Samar, where U.S. concentration camp policies and scorched-earth tactics devastated civilian populations. The uncertainty itself is a teaching point: when official records are kept by the occupying power, and when that power has an interest in minimizing reported civilian deaths, the historical record has structural gaps. The range reflects that problem honestly.</p>

<h4>📈 How These Numbers Compare — Speak This, Don't Slide It</h4>
<p>If students need the scale made concrete, these comparisons land hard when spoken:</p>
<p><strong>American combat deaths in context:</strong> The Mexican-American War killed roughly 1,700 Americans in combat. The Spanish-American War — the one that lasted 109 days and made Roosevelt famous — killed around 400. The Philippine-American War killed more Americans in combat than both of those wars combined. The reason it doesn't register that way in American memory is the shadow of the Civil War, which killed approximately 620,000. Against that number, 4,200 looks small. Against every other war America had fought to that point, it was the costliest since Appomattox.</p>
<p><strong>Filipino civilian deaths in context:</strong> The total population of the Philippines at the time was approximately 7 to 8 million people. The low estimate of 200,000 civilian dead represents roughly 2.5% of every man, woman, and child in the country. The high estimate of 600,000 represents closer to 8%. Translate that to today's United States: 8% of the current American population is approximately 27 million people. The closest comparable civilian death tolls from 19th century colonial warfare are the Belgian Congo and the British concentration camps during the Boer War — both of which were internationally condemned at the time. The Philippine-American War belongs in that company. It largely isn't placed there in American historical memory, and that absence is worth naming explicitly.</p>

<h4>⏱️ The Fourteen Years — Three Phases</h4>
<p>Be precise if students ask about the timeline. The conflict had three distinct phases: conventional war against the Philippine Republic from February 1899 through Aguinaldo's capture in March 1901; guerrilla resistance under scattered commanders through the official U.S. declaration of victory in July 1902; and the Moro Rebellion in the southern Philippines — Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago — which continued until 1913. The Moros were Muslim, had never been fully subdued by Spain, and fought under a completely different political and religious framework than Aguinaldo's republic. The U.S. government treated the Moro conflict as a separate "pacification" problem — which is exactly the kind of definitional manipulation the lecture is already teaching students to recognize. Where you draw the line on "when it ended" depends entirely on who gets to draw it.</p>

<h4>🔗 Connecting to the Lecture Title</h4>
<p>The callout earns the lecture title directly. The Spanish-American War — the one students watched a documentary about, the one that lasted 109 days and made Roosevelt famous — produced a second war that lasted a generation, killed hundreds of thousands of civilians, and has largely disappeared from American historical memory. That disappearance is not accidental. A war the government called an insurrection, fought against people it called incapable of self-government, produced casualties it had reasons not to count carefully. The lecture is about that gap — between what happened and what was remembered.</p>

<aside class="notes"><h4>📖 Why This Section Comes First</h4>
<p>Before the lecture can tell you what the U.S. did in the Philippines, it needs to establish who was already there. The standard American narrative of 1898 tends to treat the Philippines as a prize won from Spain — passive, waiting, undefined. This section corrects that. By the time American soldiers arrived, the Philippines had an organized independence movement, military forces, political leadership, and a functioning revolutionary government. Understanding that changes everything about what followed.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>🇵🇭 The Philippines Before the U.S. Arrived</h4>
<p>Two years before any American soldier set foot in the Philippines, Filipinos had already launched a revolution. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katipunan" target="_blank"><strong>Katipunan</strong></a> — a secret revolutionary society — began armed revolt against Spain in 1896. This was not a spontaneous uprising. It had newspapers, ideology, a military structure, and mass participation. By June 1898, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Aguinaldo" target="_blank">Emilio Aguinaldo</a> had declared Philippine independence. By January 1899, the Philippines had ratified a constitution and established the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Philippine_Republic" target="_blank">Malolos Republic</a> — with a president, a cabinet, and a legislature.</p>
<h4>⚠️ What This Means</h4>
<p>The people the United States was about to govern had not been consulted — and they had not been sitting still waiting to be governed. They had spent two years fighting for their independence from one colonial power. When the United States arrived presenting itself as a liberator, Aguinaldo had reasonable grounds to expect that liberation meant independence. What he got instead was a new colonial master — and he chose to fight.</p></aside>

    <aside class="notes">
        <h4>📖 Read This Carefully — It's a Precise Political Argument</h4>
        <p>Aguinaldo's January 1899 proclamation is not the confused protest of someone who doesn't understand what's happening. It is a <strong>specific, accurate, and sophisticated political argument</strong>. He identifies exactly what the U.S. is doing — replacing one colonial power with another — and he calls it what it is: seizure of territory by a nation that claims to champion freedom. The phrase "we are not savages ignorant of how to govern ourselves" is a direct rebuttal to the civilizational justifications that American politicians were already deploying in Congress.</p>
        
        <h4>💡 Core Arguments (Moved from Slide)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>This is a <strong>precise political argument</strong> — not a confused response.</li>
            <li>He was right that the U.S. was replacing one colonial power with another.</li>
            <li>He was right that Filipinos had the capacity for self-governance.</li>
            <li>He lost the war anyway.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>💡 Historiography: He Was Right</h4>
        <p>Aguinaldo's claim that the U.S. was arrogating to itself the title of "champion of oppressed nations" while oppressing a nation was an accurate description of the contradiction at the heart of American imperial policy. Senator Albert Beveridge would stand on the Senate floor that same month and argue that Filipinos were racially unfit for self-government. Aguinaldo's proclamation was a direct answer to that argument — made before Beveridge even delivered it.</p>

<aside class="notes"><h4>⚠️ This Was Not a Misunderstanding — It Was a Power Struggle</h4>
<p>The slide lists two sets of assumptions — American and Filipino — and it would be easy to read this as a tragic miscommunication, two sides talking past each other. That reading is too comfortable. <strong>Both sides understood the disagreement perfectly.</strong> The Americans knew Filipinos wanted independence. The Filipinos knew the Americans intended to stay. The conflict wasn't caused by confusion — it was caused by one side having the military and economic power to impose its assumptions on the other.</p>
<h4>📌 Notice the Word "Ingratitude"</h4>
<p>The American framing of Filipino resistance as <em>ingratitude</em> is worth sitting with. It assumes that American presence was inherently a gift — that the Filipinos should have been thankful for occupation. That assumption required believing that Filipinos were incapable of governing themselves, that American rule was genuinely benevolent, and that independence was something to be earned rather than a right. Aguinaldo's proclamation directly challenged all three. The "ingratitude" framing was a way of refusing to engage with his argument.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>🤔 A Question Worth Sitting With Honestly</h4>
<p>By January 1899, the Philippines had a constitution, a president, a legislature, and an army. On what grounds did the United States claim authority to govern them? The lecture will surface three common answers students arrive at:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purchase from Spain:</strong> The U.S. paid Spain $20 million for the Philippines — but can sovereignty be bought and sold like property without the consent of the people involved?</li>
<li><strong>Military victory:</strong> American forces defeated the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay — but defeating one colonial power doesn't automatically grant you the right to replace it</li>
<li><strong>"Civilizational" arguments:</strong> Filipinos weren't "ready" for self-rule — but who decides readiness, and what are the criteria?</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these answers is satisfying on its own — and the lecture's job is to show what those justifications actually produced in practice. The question isn't resolved here. Hold it.</p></aside>

<p>Pay attention to the language the U.S. government used: not "war," but "pacification campaign." Not "soldiers," but "insurgents." Not "enemy combatants," but "criminals." That language wasn't accidental — it was doing political work, and this section will show you exactly what work it was doing and why it mattered for what the U.S. military was permitted to do.</p></aside></section>

<li>Filipino response: shift to <strong>guerrilla warfare</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="bottom-text" style="font-size:1.8em;">The language matters. "Insurgents" are criminals. Soldiers are combatants. The word choice determined how violence was permitted to proceed.</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>💥 How the War Started</h4>
<p>On the night of February 4, 1899, American sentries shot two Filipino soldiers near Manila. Within hours, fighting had spread across the city. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine%E2%80%93American_War" target="_blank">Philippine-American War</a> had begun — though the U.S. government refused to call it that for over a century. Officially, it was a "pacification campaign" against "insurgents." That word choice had real legal and moral consequences: soldiers are covered by the laws of war; insurgents and criminals are not.</p>
<h4>📌 Why the Language Mattered</h4>
<p>Calling Filipino fighters "insurgents" rather than soldiers accomplished several things at once. It delegitimized the Philippine Republic and its constitution. It framed armed resistance to occupation as criminality rather than self-defense. It removed Filipino fighters from the protections of the laws of war. And it made the conflict sound like a policing problem rather than a war — smaller, more manageable, and less morally fraught than it actually was. The language was doing the work that justification couldn't do directly.</p>
<h4>💡 The Military Logic That Followed</h4>
<p>Filipino conventional forces lost quickly — American industrial firepower overwhelmed set-piece resistance by mid-1899. The Filipino response was to shift to guerrilla warfare, which was militarily rational given the power imbalance. That shift then triggered a specific American counterinsurgency logic — one whose conclusions the next slides document in full.</p></aside>
</section>
<!-- SLIDE: Guerrilla Logic -->
<section>
<h2 style="font-size:4.0em;">The Logic of Counterinsurgency</h2>
<div class="callout" style="font-size:2.0em;">
<strong>The problem:</strong> When conventional resistance fails, guerrilla fighters rely on civilian support — food, shelter, intelligence.
    </div>
<ul style="font-size:2.0em; margin-top:0.8em;">
<li>You cannot defeat guerrillas without <strong>separating them from the civilian population</strong></li>
<li>That separation requires controlling civilians</li>
<li>Controlling civilians at scale requires coercion</li>
<li>This logic is <em>militarily rational</em></li>
<li>It is also <em>humanly catastrophic</em></li>
</ul>
<div class="bottom-text-bold" style="font-size:1.8em;">The tactics that follow are not aberrations. They are the conclusions of this logic.</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>⚙️ Follow the Logic — It Leads Somewhere Specific</h4>
<p>This slide asks you to follow a chain of military reasoning that is, in its own terms, coherent. Guerrilla fighters depend on civilian support — food, shelter, intelligence. You cannot defeat them by killing fighters alone, because fighters blend back into the civilian population. Therefore, to defeat the guerrillas, you must separate them from civilians. Separating fighters from civilians at the scale of an entire archipelago requires controlling where civilians live, what they eat, and who they talk to. Controlling civilians at scale requires coercion. <strong>This logic is militarily rational. It is also humanly catastrophic.</strong></p>
<h4>⚠️ The Crucial Point</h4>
<p>The tactics that follow in this lecture — reconcentration camps, food destruction, village burning — are not aberrations by rogue soldiers. They are the conclusions of this logic, applied systematically. Understanding that is not the same as excusing it. It means that moral responsibility doesn't rest only with the soldiers who carried out the tactics. It rests with the commanders who ordered them, the officials who approved them, and the politicians who funded a war whose logic made them inevitable.</p></aside>

</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>💭 What This Exercise Is For</h4>
<p>Before the lecture shows you what the U.S. actually did, it's asking you to reason toward it yourself. If guerrilla fighters depend on civilian support, and you need to eliminate that support, what are your options? Think through it honestly. You'll likely arrive at some version of: move civilians into controlled zones, cut off food supplies to areas where fighters operate, make it costly for civilians to cooperate with fighters. <strong>You've just described reconcentration camps and deliberate famine as military strategy.</strong></p>
<p>That's not an accident. The exercise is designed to show you that these tactics weren't invented by uniquely evil men — they were the conclusions that rational military planners reached when given a specific problem. That makes them more disturbing, not less. Evil that follows a logic is harder to prevent than evil that comes from individual wickedness.</p></aside>

<div class="bottom-text-bold" style="font-size:1.8em; margin-top:1em;">This asymmetry is not incidental. It reflects the difference between an occupying army and a civilian population caught in between.</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>📊 Numbers That Require Attention</h4>
<p>200,000 to 700,000 Filipino civilian deaths. That range is wide because the historical record is incomplete — the U.S. military did not keep careful count of civilian deaths, which is itself a form of evidence about how the war was being conducted. For comparison: approximately 4,200 American military personnel died, mostly in combat. The asymmetry is not incidental. It reflects the difference between an organized army with industrial firepower and a civilian population caught between guerrilla fighters and counterinsurgency operations.</p>
<h4>⚠️ Why Most Deaths Were Civilian</h4>
<p>The majority of Filipino deaths came not from battlefield combat but from <strong>famine and disease deliberately caused by U.S. military strategy</strong> — the destruction of food supplies, the burning of crops and livestock, the forced relocation of civilians into reconcentration zones where disease spread rapidly. This was not collateral damage in the ordinary sense. It was a predictable and predicted consequence of tactics that military commanders knew would cause mass civilian suffering. The numbers are the evidence that the strategy worked as designed.</p>
<h4>🎓 Historians Weigh In</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Village burning:</strong> Destruction of civilian homes and structures as collective punishment for harboring or supplying guerrillas</li>
<li><strong>Population relocation:</strong> Forcing civilians into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconcentration_camps_in_the_Philippines" target="_blank">reconcentration zones</a> — controlled areas where food, movement, and contact were monitored</li>
<li><strong>Destruction of food supplies:</strong> Burning crops, killing livestock, destroying stores — deliberate famine as military strategy</li>
<li><strong>Water cure torture:</strong> Interrogation technique (detailed on the next slide)</li>
</ul>
<h4>⚠️ The Cuba Comparison — Read This Carefully</h4>
<p>In 1897–98, American newspapers ran front-page outrage about Spanish <em>reconcentration camps</em> in Cuba — General Weyler's policy of forcing Cuban civilians into controlled zones, where they died of disease and starvation by the tens of thousands. That outrage was one of the primary drivers of American intervention in Cuba. By 1901, the U.S. Army was running reconcentration camps in the Philippines using the same logic and producing the same results. <strong>Same word. Same practice. Same consequences. Three years later.</strong> The hypocrisy is not subtle, and it was documented in real time by American critics — who are covered in Section V.</p></aside>

</ul>
<aside class="notes"><h4>⚠️ What It Was — Described Plainly</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cure_(torture)" target="_blank">water cure</a> was a torture technique used systematically in the Philippines. Interrogators forced water — sometimes contaminated — into a prisoner's mouth and stomach through repeated pouring until the abdomen visibly distended. Then they compressed or beat the abdomen to expel it. Then repeated. Until the prisoner talked, lost consciousness, or died. This is not a disputed description — it comes from the soldiers who administered it, testifying under oath before the United States Senate.</p>
<h4>📌 Why "Not a Rogue Practice" Matters</h4>
<p>The water cure was widespread enough to generate Senate hearings, press coverage, and official military investigations. Soldiers who testified described it matter-of-factly — some defended it as effective. Officers who knew about it and failed to stop it received mild or no punishment. This is the evidence that the water cure was not the aberration of a few bad actors. It was a practice the institution knew about, tolerated, and in many cases implicitly authorized. When a practice is widespread, documented, and produces no serious institutional consequences, it is institutionally sanctioned — whatever the official policy says.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>📖 Read What the Slide Is Doing</h4>
<p>The Senate testimony quoted here was heard by United States senators in 1902. They heard soldiers describe, under oath, in plain language, exactly what the water cure involved. <strong>The war continued.</strong> That three-word sentence at the bottom of the slide is doing a lot of work. It tells you that the decision to continue the war was made with full knowledge of what was happening. Not ignorance. Not a failure of information. Knowledge — followed by a choice to continue.</p>
<h4>💡 What This Means for Moral Responsibility</h4>
<p>This is the slide that makes the "few bad apples" explanation impossible. Bad apple arguments require that the institution didn't know, couldn't have stopped it, or moved swiftly to correct it when it did know. The Senate hearings are evidence that the institution knew. The continuation of the war is evidence that knowledge did not produce correction. The gap between what was known and what was done is itself a moral and historical fact — one that this lecture asks you to sit with rather than resolve too quickly.</p></aside>

        <h4>🗣️ Presenter Notes (~2.5 mins)</h4>
        <p>Before the famous American response, we must understand the tactical pressure that led to the explosion of violence. Samar was a major guerrilla base under General Lukban, and the U.S. response was a brutal counter-insurgency. General Hughes wasn't just fighting soldiers; he was trying to starve the island into submission by burning rice stores and killing livestock.</p>
        <p>In August, Company C moved into Balangiga to tighten this noose. The tension reached a breaking point over forced labor and the seizure of the town's food stores. The attack itself was a masterpiece of clandestine planning: guerrillas dressed as women and used coffins to smuggle bolos past sentries, claiming they were burying children who died of cholera.</p>
        <p>On the morning of September 28, the police chief grabbed a sentry’s rifle, the church bells began to peal, and the town rose up. Forty-eight Americans died—mostly hacked to death during breakfast. This massive loss of life is what triggered the "Howling Wilderness" orders we will see <strong>next</strong>.</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  This slide does something that takes intellectual courage: it includes documented Filipino atrocities against American soldiers. That might surprise you — why would a lecture critical of American imperialism include this material? Because honest history requires it. Leaving it out would be selective, and selectivity is a form of dishonesty. Your professor is modeling what rigorous historical thinking actually looks like.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Breaking It Down</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Torture of U.S. prisoners</strong>: U.S. Army reports and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Philippines" target="_blank">1902 Senate hearings</a> documented cases of beatings, hot irons, burial alive, and staking prisoners on anthills. These weren't rumors — they appeared in official military records.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Mutilation of bodies</strong>: Ears, noses, and genitals were cut from American corpses and sometimes placed in the victims' mouths. This practice, horrifying as it is, has a long history in guerrilla warfare — it is an act of psychological terror aimed at demoralizing the enemy and symbolically asserting power over a technologically superior opponent.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>Execution of prisoners</strong>: Filipino forces rarely held American prisoners long-term. Captives were often executed, partly because a guerrilla force operating in jungle terrain simply could not manage prisoners the way a conventional army with supply lines and camps could.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <strong>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Balangiga" target="_blank">Balangiga attack</a> (September 28, 1901)</strong>: Filipino fighters launched a surprise attack on a U.S. garrison in Balangiga, Samar, killing dozens of soldiers. In the chaotic aftermath, many of the dead and wounded were hacked with <em>bolos</em> (large Filipino machetes). The American response — General Smith's "kill everyone over ten" order and the devastation of Samar — came directly from this attack.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Here is the analytical frame this course uses: <strong>colonial wars brutalize everyone they touch.</strong> Understanding why Filipino forces committed these acts does not excuse them — it explains them. A resistance movement facing systematic village burning, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_camp#Philippines" target="_blank">reconcentration camps</a>, food destruction, and racial dehumanization from an industrialized occupying army operates in conditions of desperation and rage that make cycles of atrocity almost structurally inevitable.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  The critical distinction historians insist on is <em>scale and institutional backing</em>. American atrocities were larger in scale, more systematic, and carried out with the full resources of a state — army, navy, and official policy. Filipino atrocities were real, but they do not cancel or "balance" the documented U.S. policies of water torture, food denial, and "howling wilderness" orders. Both belong in the same lecture. A history that condemns only one side is propaganda. A history that treats all sides as equivalent regardless of scale and context is also dishonest. Precision is the goal.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">🎓 Historians Weigh In</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: 1em;">Paul A. Kramer – <em>The Blood of Government: Race, Empire, the United States, and the Philippines</em></h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  Kramer argues that racial ideology shaped how Americans understood both their own violence and Filipino violence. American atrocities were explained away as military necessity against a "savage" enemy; Filipino atrocities were used as proof that Filipinos were not ready for self-government. The atrocity record on both sides, in other words, was never processed neutrally — it was immediately enlisted in arguments about race, civilization, and empire. Kramer helps you see that what counts as an "atrocity" worth condemning is always, in part, a political question.

</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>🤔 The Hypocrisy Is Exact — That's What Makes It Worth Analyzing</h4>
<p>The United States condemned Spain for reconcentration in Cuba in 1897–98. American newspapers ran front-page outrage. That outrage helped drive the country into war. Three years later, the U.S. Army was running reconcentration camps in the Philippines using the same tactic, producing the same mass civilian deaths. <strong>Same word. Same practice. Same consequences.</strong></p>
<p>The question isn't just "isn't that hypocritical?" — of course it is. The interesting question is: <em>what mechanism allows people to see the same practice as an atrocity when the enemy does it and a military necessity when we do it?</em> The answer the lecture is building toward involves racial ideology — the dehumanizing logic that sets different thresholds for acceptable violence against different people. When Filipinos are "insurgents" rather than soldiers, when they are "not yet ready for self-government," the same tactics that were outrageous against Cubans become administratively normal. That's the mechanism worth articulating.</p></aside>

  Three vocabularies. <strong>One conclusion:</strong> American rule over other peoples is not just permissible — it is <em>obligatory</em>.
</div>
	
	<h4>🧠 Why This Slide Comes Before Beveridge</h4>
<p>Beveridge's speech doesn't make full sense without this framework. He's drawing on three deeply rooted intellectual and moral systems that his audience already accepted as legitimate. Name them now so students can recognize them operating in everything that follows.</p>

<h4>⚠️ Racialism vs. Racism — Make the Distinction Explicit</h4>
<p>Students tend to hear "racism" and think of personal prejudice — hatred, slurs, individual animus. <strong>Racialism is different and more dangerous.</strong> It is a pseudoscientific system — developed by figures like Herbert Spencer, Francis Galton, and Josiah Strong — that claimed to rank human populations on an objective, measurable hierarchy of civilizational development. It felt rigorous. It used the vocabulary of Darwin, evolution, and biology. It appeared in academic journals and university curricula. Racialists weren't necessarily hateful — many were reformers, scientists, and progressives who believed they were describing nature, not expressing prejudice. That's what made it so powerful: it presented white supremacy as a fact of nature rather than a choice.</p>

<h4>🔬 Social Darwinism — The Mechanism</h4>
<p>Racialism and Social Darwinism are related but distinct. Racialism is the hierarchy — the ranking of races on a scale of civilizational fitness. Social Darwinism is the competitive mechanism that justified it: Spencer's "survival of the fittest" applied to nations and peoples rather than individual organisms. Together they produced the imperial conclusion: advanced civilizations don't just have the <em>right</em> to expand — they have a biological and historical <em>obligation</em> to do so. Students already encountered this logic in the eugenics lecture. Connect that explicitly: the same pseudoscientific system that justified sterilizing "unfit" Americans at home justified governing "unfit" peoples abroad. Same logic, different scale.</p>

<h4>📜 White Man's Burden — The Inversion</h4>
<p>Kipling published the poem in February 1899, timed precisely to influence the Senate debate over ratifying the Treaty of Paris. The poem's propagandistic genius is the inversion it performs: the colonizer is the one who suffers. You send your sons to die, you are mocked and blamed, your sacrifice goes unappreciated — and you do it anyway because it is right. Empire is not exploitation; it is duty. That reframing made colonial war morally sustainable for a democratic public that needed to believe it was doing good.</p>

<h4>✝️ Christian Mission — Flag the Next Slide</h4>
<p>Keep McKinley brief here — the next slide gives him his own full primary source treatment. The key point is "salvation and sovereignty arrived together": Protestant missionaries followed the military into the Philippines, building schools and hospitals alongside soldiers conducting pacification. The spiritual and the imperial were not separate tracks. They were the same project.</p>

<h4>🔗 The Synthesis</h4>
<p>The callout is the analytical payoff: three separate vocabularies — scientific, moral, religious — all converging on the same conclusion. Empire isn't a choice; it's an obligation. That convergence is what gave American imperialism genuine popular support. This wasn't elite cynicism trickling down. Millions of ordinary Americans sincerely held this worldview. That's what makes it worth studying carefully — and what makes it recognizable in other contexts.</p></aside>

</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>📜 Why This Quote Is Extraordinary</h4>
<p>McKinley told this story himself — voluntarily, to a group of Methodist ministers — as a justification for keeping the Philippines. He wasn't embarrassed by it. He thought it was the most compelling case he could make: that divine guidance had led him to the decision. That sincerity is precisely the point. This is not a cynical politician manufacturing a religious cover story. This is a man who genuinely believed God had directed American foreign policy, and who thought that made the case stronger, not stranger.</p>

<h4>✝️ The Catholic Irony — Don't Let It Go By</h4>
<p>Spend a moment on the callout. Spain colonized the Philippines beginning in 1565 — named for King Philip II. Over more than three centuries of colonial rule, Catholic missionaries converted the vast majority of the population. By 1899, the Philippines was one of the most thoroughly Catholic societies in Asia. When McKinley said God called him to "Christianize" Filipinos, he was proposing to bring Protestant Christianity to a people who had been Catholic for longer than the United States had existed as a nation. The "Christianizing" mission was never really about converting pagans. It was about remaking Filipino culture in a Protestant Anglo-American image — and about wrapping political conquest in the vocabulary of spiritual salvation.</p>

<h4>🔗 Connection to the Ideological Framework</h4>
<p>Notice how McKinley's account draws on all three threads from the previous slide simultaneously: the civilizational hierarchy of Social Darwinism ("uplift and civilize"), the self-sacrificial duty of White Man's Burden ("nothing left for us to do but take them"), and the divine mandate of Christian mission ("Christianize them"). These weren't separate arguments he was stitching together — they were a single integrated worldview in which American expansion felt morally obligatory rather than politically chosen. That integration is what gave it its power.</p>

<h4>🤔 Discussion Prompt</h4>
<p>Ask students: "If McKinley genuinely believed this, does that make the decision more or less defensible? Does sincerity change the moral weight of the outcome?" Let them sit with it — there's no clean answer, and that's the point.</p></aside>

        When a government can describe the destruction of a civilian population as <strong>"pacification,"</strong> language itself has become a tool of power.
    </div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>📌 Two Ways of Saying the Same Thing</h4>
<p>A soldier testifies under oath: <em>"We burned it."</em> An official Army report reads: <em>"Pacification operations completed in the district of Batangas."</em> The same event. The same actions. Two completely different moral worlds. "Pacification" is a word that makes violence sound administrative — a technical process with a benevolent goal. It removes the fire, the people running, the village that no longer exists. It places the burden of causation on the people being "pacified" — implying that the violence was made necessary by their failure to cooperate.</p>
<h4>💡 Language as a Tool of Power</h4>
<p>When a government can describe the destruction of a civilian population as "pacification," language has become a tool of power. This is not unique to the Philippines or to 1901. Official language in every imperial context performs this function — making violence invisible, making coercion sound benevolent, and making resistance sound like the real problem. Learning to read official language critically — to ask what it's concealing and what work it's doing — is one of the most durable skills this lecture can give you.</p></aside>

	<aside class="notes"><h4>📖 Beveridge Believed What He Said</h4>
<p>Senator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Beveridge" target="_blank">Albert Beveridge's</a> 1900 Senate speech is worth reading in full — it's one of the most articulate expressions of American imperial ideology ever put into the congressional record. He believed in both democracy and civilizational hierarchy simultaneously. He was not lying about his convictions. He genuinely thought that American expansion was a divine mission, that Filipinos were not yet capable of self-government, and that American rule — however coercive — was ultimately in Filipino interests. <strong>Empire was not cynical cover. It was genuine moral conviction.</strong></p>
<h4>⚠️ Why Genuine Belief Is Not a Defense</h4>
<p>The sincerity of Beveridge's belief doesn't make it less dangerous — it makes it more so. Cynical operators who know they're doing wrong can be shamed into stopping. True believers cannot. And Beveridge was not alone: many American Progressives — people who supported labor rights, regulation of corporations, conservation — also supported the Philippine occupation. The same moral framework that told them government should improve people's lives also told them that some people weren't yet capable of improving their own. <strong>Progressive imperialism is not a contradiction. It is a coherent worldview with horrifying consequences.</strong></p>
<h4>🖼️ Look at the "School Begins" Cartoon</h4>
<p>The 1899 <em>Puck</em> cartoon "School Begins" depicts Uncle Sam as a schoolteacher with new pupils — the Philippines, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii — represented as children of color, while white children (representing existing states) sit at their desks looking on. Native Americans and Chinese students sit in the back. The cartoon was published approvingly. It captures the civilizational hierarchy that animated American imperial ideology — the assumption that some peoples were children who needed to be taught, and that the United States had both the right and the duty to teach them.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes">
	<div class="bottom-text-bold" style="font-size:1.8em;">The overseas color line and the domestic color line were not separate systems. They were <em>the same system</em>, deployed in two different places.</div>
	<h4>🔗 Source, Then Applications</h4>
<p>The three-column structure makes the causal chain explicit: racialism and Social Darwinism are the <em>source ideology</em> — the pseudoscientific framework that ranked human populations on a hierarchy of civilizational fitness and presented that ranking as natural law. Jim Crow and the Philippine occupation are both <em>applications</em> of that framework in two different theaters. Students need to see that relationship clearly: the domestic and overseas systems weren't just analogous — they drew from the same intellectual well, used the same vocabulary, and were often defended by the same people.</p>
<h4>🏠 Jim Crow as Domestic Racialism</h4>
<p>The language used to justify Jim Crow — Black Americans as not yet ready for full civic participation, requiring supervision and guidance, prone to disorder without firm governance — is structurally identical to the language used about Filipinos. This wasn't coincidence. It was the same framework. Many of the senators who voted to retain the Philippines also supported disenfranchisement at home. The racial hierarchy didn't recognize a border between domestic and foreign policy.</p>
<h4>🌏 The Philippines as Overseas Racialism</h4>
<p>Racial hierarchy did something specific and measurable in the Philippines: it lowered the threshold for acceptable violence. Different rules applied to people constructed as "not fully civilized." This is why Jacob Smith's orders could be issued, carried out, and met with a mild reprimand. A court-martial that ended in retirement rather than prison was the institutional expression of the same logic the slide is describing.</p>
<h4>✊ The Critics Who Saw It Clearly</h4>
<p>Black American critics of the Philippine war — covered in Section V — saw the connection immediately and said so publicly. They were living under one version of the same logic being applied to Filipinos. Figures like David Fagen, who defected to the Filipino side, and journalists like Ida B. Wells made the argument explicitly: you cannot fight for Filipino freedom while denying it at home. The overseas and domestic systems were not analogous. They were continuous — and some Americans in 1899 understood that with perfect clarity.</p></aside>

  The problem with this logic: it has <strong>no limiting principle.</strong><br/>
  The timeline can always be extended. "Not yet" can last forever.
</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>📖 The Argument — Stated Precisely</h4>
<p>Roosevelt's position on the Philippines had a coherent internal logic: liberty requires order; order requires force; force in service of freedom is regrettable but necessary; Filipino resistance to American rule is therefore not political self-determination but criminality — an obstacle to the very freedom it claims to pursue. This is the argument of <strong>"liberal imperialism"</strong> — the claim that coercion in the short term serves freedom in the long term, and that the occupying power is the legitimate judge of when the short term ends.</p>
<h4>⚠️ The Problem With the Logic</h4>
<p>Roosevelt's framework has no limiting principle. "Not yet ready for self-government" can always be extended. The timeline for when coercion becomes liberty can always be pushed forward. And the occupying power — which benefits from the occupation — is simultaneously the judge of when the occupation has achieved its stated purpose. The anti-imperialists understood this immediately. That's why they called it what it was.</p>
<h4>🔗 But History Complicated the Argument</h4>
<p>The "no limiting principle" critique is analytically sound against Roosevelt's 1902 logic — but the next slide shows why history didn't simply confirm it. The limiting principle that Roosevelt's framework couldn't generate internally came from somewhere else: Congress. That's the more interesting analytical point, and it's where the lecture goes next.</p></aside>

  In the 20th century, European colonial powers fought wars to hold their empires. <strong>The United States kept its word.</strong>
</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>📖 Why This Slide Has to Exist</h4>
<p>The previous slide makes a legitimate critique of Roosevelt's imperial logic — it has no internal limiting principle. But intellectual honesty requires the next step: in the Philippine case specifically, history didn't confirm that "not yet" lasted forever. The limiting principle came from Congress, not from Roosevelt, and not from the logic of liberal imperialism itself. That's an important distinction. Democratic institutions eventually corrected what imperial logic couldn't self-correct. That correction took decades and caused enormous suffering in the meantime — but it happened, and it happened voluntarily.</p>
<h4>🌍 The Comparative Context — This Was Genuinely Unusual</h4>
<p>Put this in comparative perspective for students. When European colonial powers faced independence movements in the 20th century, the pattern was almost uniformly violent resistance followed by reluctant or chaotic withdrawal: France fought wars in Indochina and Algeria. The Dutch fought in Indonesia. The Belgians abandoned the Congo in chaos with no transition infrastructure. The British managed relatively peaceful departures in some cases — India being the most significant — but partition produced catastrophic violence. The American departure from the Philippines in 1946, in the immediate aftermath of a war that had devastated the islands, was by those standards remarkably orderly. That doesn't erase what came before. But it is part of the historical record and students should have it.</p>
<h4>⚖️ Holding Both Things True</h4>
<p>The full analytical picture requires holding two things simultaneously: the occupation began in violence, was sustained by torture and mass civilian death, and was justified by a racial hierarchy that denied Filipino humanity and capacity for self-governance — AND the United States ultimately kept a promise that most colonial powers never made, on a timeline that most colonial powers never honored. These are not contradictory. They are both true. The task isn't to decide whether America was good or bad. It's to understand how democratic institutions can produce both outcomes — and what that tells us about how change actually happens.</p>
<h4>💡 The Analytical Payoff</h4>
<p>Roosevelt's liberal imperialist logic said the occupying power would decide when the occupied people were ready. What actually generated the deadline was congressional legislation responding to domestic political pressure — anti-imperialist organizing, Filipino lobbying in Washington, changing public opinion. That's not imperial goodwill. That's democratic politics working, slowly and imperfectly, to correct an imperial wrong. That mechanism — pressure, legislation, institutional response — is worth students understanding, because it's how most corrections to American policy have actually worked.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>🤔 Which Is More Dangerous?</h4>
<p>The slide offers four options — cynics who do wrong knowing it's wrong; true believers who do wrong convinced they're right; institutions that normalize both; citizens who don't ask. This is a genuine question, not a trick, and all four answers are defensible. But push yourself to choose one and build the case.</p>
<h4>💡 The Case for C or D</h4>
<p>Individual bad actors — cynics and true believers alike — can be identified, removed, prosecuted. The more durable problem is the institution that normalizes both: that accepts "pacification" as a description of mass violence, that retires Jacob Smith with full honors, that continues a war after Senate testimony about torture. Institutional normalization doesn't require individual bad intent. It just requires that the institution's incentives, language, and procedures make certain questions hard to ask. And citizens who don't ask — who consume the official language without interrogating it — are the condition under which institutional normalization persists. That's the question this lecture is really asking: what allows democratic citizens to fund and support a colonial war while believing they're doing good?</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>📖 Empire Was Contested — Seriously</h4>
<p>It would be easy to read the history of the Philippine-American War as a story with only perpetrators and victims. This section corrects that. There were Americans who said no — publicly, loudly, with sophisticated arguments — and some of their names are ones you know. The anti-imperialist challenge wasn't a fringe position. It was a serious political movement that included former presidents, major industrialists, prominent writers, and Black journalists who understood the connection between overseas imperialism and domestic racial hierarchy better than almost anyone.</p></aside></section>

<aside class="notes"><h4>📋 Who Said No</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Imperialist_League" target="_blank">Anti-Imperialist League</a>, founded in 1898, was ideologically diverse in ways that are worth noting. <strong>Mark Twain</strong> was a satirist who attacked imperial ideology with devastating precision. <strong>Andrew Carnegie</strong> was one of the richest men in America and offered to personally buy the Philippines its independence. <strong>Grover Cleveland</strong> was a former president who found empire incompatible with republican principles. <strong>Booker T. Washington</strong> and <strong>Ida B. Wells</strong> — from very different positions within Black American politics — both opposed the war for reasons rooted in the connection between overseas racial hierarchy and domestic Jim Crow.</p>
<h4>💡 The Core Argument</h4>
<p>The anti-imperialists' central claim was not simply that the war was brutal — though it was. Their argument was constitutional and philosophical: <strong>governing without consent corrupts the democracy doing the governing, not just the people being governed.</strong> Empire requires practices — arbitrary detention, military tribunals, denial of civil liberties — that are incompatible with republican self-government. You cannot maintain those practices abroad indefinitely without them migrating home. That argument was not resolved in 1902. It is still being made.</p></aside>

<aside class="notes"><h4>🔗 The Argument Only They Could Make Fully</h4>
<p>Black American critics of the Philippine War had a specific and uniquely powerful argument: they were living under the same racial logic being applied to Filipinos. The claim that Filipinos were "not ready for self-government" and required American supervision was the same claim used to justify disenfranchisement, segregation, and violence against Black Americans at home. <strong>You cannot deploy racial hierarchy abroad while claiming to dismantle it at home. The two projects are incompatible.</strong></p>
<h4>👤 David Fagen and the Limits of Loyalty</h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fagen" target="_blank">David Fagen</a> — a Black corporal in the 24th Infantry — crossed over to fight with Aguinaldo's forces in 1899 and continued fighting for nearly two years. His decision was not random. Black soldiers in the Philippines had been ordered to enforce on Filipinos the same racial subordination they were subjected to at home. Some refused. Fagen's defection was the most dramatic expression of a recognition many Black soldiers shared: that the color line being drawn in the Philippines and the color line being drawn in the American South were the same line, drawn by the same hand, for the same reasons.</p>
<h4>🎓 Historians Weigh In</h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Gatewood" target="_blank">Willard Gatewood</a>, <em>Black Americans and the White Man's Burden</em> (1975): Black soldiers in the Philippines occupied an impossible position — serving an army that segregated them, enforcing a racial hierarchy on people who called them by the same slurs white Americans used against them, and fighting for an empire whose racial logic was continuous with the Jim Crow system they returned home to.</p></aside>

<h2 style="font-size:4.5em;">Twain's Satire: Taking It at Its Word</h2>
<div class="primary-source" style="font-size:1.9em;">
        "We have pacified some thousands of the islanders and buried them; destroyed their fields; burned their villages, and turned their widows and orphans out of doors; furnished heartbreak by exile to some dozens of disagreeable patriots; subjugated the remaining ten millions by Benevolent Assimilation..."
        <div class="primary-source-attribution">— Mark Twain, "To the Person Sitting in Darkness," 1901</div>
</div>
<div class="callout" style="font-size:2.0em; margin-top:0.8em;">
        Twain is not exaggerating for effect. He is <strong>summarizing the record.</strong> That is what makes it devastating.
    </div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>✍️ How Satire Works as Historical Evidence</h4>
<p>Mark Twain's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_Person_Sitting_in_Darkness" target="_blank">"To the Person Sitting in Darkness"</a> (1901) is one of the most effective pieces of anti-imperial writing in American history — and understanding why it works helps you understand what made imperial ideology so vulnerable to this kind of attack. Twain doesn't argue against empire in the abstract. He takes the official language of "Benevolent Assimilation" completely seriously and applies it directly to what was actually happening. The result is devastating because <strong>Twain is not exaggerating. He is summarizing the documented record.</strong></p>
<h4>💡 What Makes It Devastating</h4>
<p>The passage on the slide — "we have pacified some thousands of the islanders and buried them" — works because every word in it is defensible. The islands were being "pacified." People were being buried. The word "benevolent assimilation" was Roosevelt's own phrase. Twain's technique is to put the official language next to what it was describing, and let the gap do the work. When "Benevolent Assimilation" means burning villages and killing people who bear arms — and "capable of bearing arms" means males over ten — the language has become its own indictment. Read the full essay if you want to see this technique extended across fifteen pages.</p></aside>

</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>🤔 The Anti-Imperialists' Deepest Claim</h4>
<p>The anti-imperialists argued something more specific than "the war is wrong." They argued that <strong>governing without consent corrupts the democracy doing the governing</strong> — that empire doesn't just harm the occupied population, it deforms the occupying democracy. The practices required to maintain colonial rule — military tribunals, suspension of civil liberties, systematic torture, denial of political rights — are incompatible with republican self-government. Import them into the imperial project and you create institutional habits, legal precedents, and political cultures that don't stay neatly overseas.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: does the evidence from this lecture support that argument? The water cure. The Senate hearings that produced no serious consequences. Jacob Smith's full-honors retirement. The official language that made mass violence sound administrative. Is there evidence that the practices of colonial governance were corrupting democratic institutions at home — or is that too strong a claim? What would you need to see to decide?</p></aside>

<p>The final section is where the lecture's argument comes together. Everything you've seen — Filipino political agency, counterinsurgency logic, documented atrocities, the language of empire, the anti-imperialist challenge — converges on four questions that the United States faced in 1899 and never fully resolved.

Some of the most important political questions are ones that endure precisely because they resist easy resolution.</p></aside></section>

<aside class="notes"><h4>❓ Four Questions Worth Taking Seriously</h4>
<p>These are not rhetorical questions designed to produce predetermined answers. They are the actual political and moral questions the United States confronted in 1899 — and they are still live questions today.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can liberty be postponed?</strong> If so, who has the authority to postpone it — and on what grounds? Note that the people whose liberty is being postponed are never the ones deciding.</li>
<li><strong>Who decides when order is sufficient for freedom to begin?</strong> In every case of liberal imperialism, the answer has been: the occupying power. That is a structural problem, not an individual one.</li>
<li><strong>How long does "temporary" rule usually last?</strong> The Canal Zone: 1903–1999. The Philippines: formal independence not until 1946. "Temporary" in imperial logic is an elastic concept.</li>
<li><strong>Where does individual moral responsibility end and structural responsibility begin?</strong> This is the hardest question. Individual soldiers carried out torture. Individual commanders issued orders. Individual senators heard testimony and continued funding the war. At what point does the structure — the institution, the ideology, the democratic citizenry — become the responsible party?</li>

<h2 style="font-size:4.5em;">What Occupation Reveals About Empire</h2>
<ul style="font-size:2.0em;">
<li>Empire requires <strong>sustained coercion at scale</strong></li>
<li>Moral language does not eliminate violence — it makes violence <em>administratively normal</em></li>
<li>Democratic states can practice colonial rule while <strong>genuinely believing</strong> they are doing good</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes"><h4>🔭 Five Things This War Teaches</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Empire requires sustained coercion at scale.</strong> There is no version of governing without consent that doesn't eventually require force — and force at the scale of an archipelago of 8 million people is not a brief intervention. It is a commitment.</li>
<li><strong>Moral language does not eliminate violence — it makes violence administratively normal.</strong> "Pacification" doesn't reduce the burning. It makes the burning easier to fund and authorize.</li>
<li><strong>Democratic states can practice colonial rule while genuinely believing they are doing good.</strong> Beveridge was sincere. Roosevelt was sincere. That sincerity was not a defense — it was a mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Colonial wars brutalize all participants.</strong> Not equally — the occupied suffer far more than the occupiers — but the dehumanization is structural and spreads through the conflict in both directions.</li>
<li><strong>Wars for liberation can become wars for control without anyone formally deciding to change course.</strong> The slide from "freeing Cuba" to "governing the Philippines" happened through a series of decisions that each seemed locally reasonable but added up to something none of their architects had explicitly chosen.</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes"><h4>🔭 The Connection to What Comes Next</h4>
<p>Lecture 3 turns to Roosevelt as president — and the question it's going to ask is whether the same man who ordered the Philippines "pacified" and presided over the documented record of this lecture is also the man who busted the trusts, created the national parks, and pushed the regulatory state into existence. The answer is yes — and understanding how those two things coexist in the same person and the same presidency is one of the central challenges of Progressive Era history.</p>
<h4>💡 The Through-Line</h4>
<p>The connection between imperial and domestic Progressivism isn't accidental. Both rest on the same foundational assumption: that expert, energetic government intervention — guided by people who know what's right — can improve society for everyone, whether or not everyone consents. The Philippines was the laboratory. The regulatory state was the experiment running simultaneously at home. Roosevelt's presidency is where those two projects met — and the friction between them reveals something important about what Progressivism was and what it could not fully see about itself.</p></aside>

<p style="font-size:0.85em; color:var(--pure-white); margin-top:0.6em;"><strong>Question:</strong> If you were an American senator in 1902 reading both documents, what would you need to believe to vote against investigating further?</p>
</div>
<aside class="notes"><h4>✏️ How to Do This Comparison Well</h4>
<p>This extension exercise gives you two descriptions of the same operations in Batangas: an official Army report and Senate testimony from soldiers who were there. The exercise is asking you to read them as a historian — not just to note that they're different, but to identify <strong>the specific word choices and framing decisions that make the Army report able to describe what the testimony describes without triggering the same moral response.</strong></p>
<h4>📌 What to Look For</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agency:</strong> Who is acting in each document? The Army report will have passive constructions; the testimony will have soldiers doing things</li>
<li><strong>Victims:</strong> Does the Army report acknowledge civilian deaths? How are they described if so?</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What goal does each document construct for the operations?</li>
<li><strong>Evaluative language:</strong> Where does the Army report use neutral or positive language for actions the testimony describes as violent?</li>
</ul>
<p>The question — "what would you need to believe to vote against investigating further?" — is asking you to reconstruct the cognitive and moral framework that made the official language persuasive. That's a sophisticated historical skill: not just identifying that language conceals, but understanding how and why it succeeds in concealing.

A secret Filipino revolutionary organization founded in Manila in 1892 that launched armed revolt against Spanish colonial rule in 1896. Led by Andrés Bonifacio and later associated with Emilio Aguinaldo, the Katipunan represented the organizational backbone of the Philippine independence movement and predated any American involvement by years.

The constitution provided for a unicameral legislature, separation of church and state, and civil liberties. Emilio Aguinaldo served as president. The republic had functioning governmental institutions before the Philippine-American War began. Its existence is historically significant because it demonstrates that the American argument — that Filipinos were "not ready for self-government" — was refuted by events before the war started.

<p>A counterinsurgency tactic used by U.S. forces in the Philippines — particularly in Batangas and Samar — in which the civilian population of a region was forcibly relocated into controlled zones, leaving the surrounding area subject to systematic destruction. Food supplies, crops, and livestock outside the zones were destroyed to deny resources to guerrilla fighters. The tactic caused massive civilian deaths from disease and starvation in the camps. The United States had used Spanish General Weyler's identical reconcentration policy in Cuba as a major justification for the Spanish-American War in 1898 — branding it the work of a "butcher." The American use of reconcentration in the Philippines just three years later is one of the clearest documented examples of the gap between imperial rhetoric and imperial practice.</p>

<div class="definition-term">Water Cure</div>
<p>A torture technique used by U.S. forces during the Philippine-American War to extract information from prisoners. The procedure involved forcing large quantities of water — sometimes contaminated — into a restrained prisoner's mouth and throat until the abdomen distended, then applying compression or beating to expel the water, and repeating the process. It was not a rogue practice: it was widespread enough to generate Senate hearings in 1902, extensive press coverage, and official military investigations. Soldiers who testified about it in Senate hearings described it matter-of-factly, and some defended it as effective. The officers who ordered it generally received minimal or no punishment. The Senate hearings produced a public record but resulted in no systematic accountability.</p>

<p>On September 28, 1901, Filipino fighters launched a coordinated surprise attack on Company C of the U.S. 9th Infantry at Balangiga on the island of Samar, killing 48 American soldiers — the deadliest Filipino attack of the war. The American response, ordered by General Jacob Smith, was the systematic devastation of Samar's interior. Smith's documented orders specified killing all males over age ten, leaving no prisoners, and turning Samar into a "howling wilderness." The campaign killed an undetermined number of civilians through direct violence, displacement, and starvation. Smith was court-martialed, received a mild reprimand, and was allowed to retire with full honors. The three church bells from Balangiga were taken as war trophies and held by the U.S. Army for over a century; they were returned to the Philippines in 2018 after decades of Filipino requests.</p>

<div class="popup" id="libimperialism-popup">
<span class="popup-close">×</span>
<div class="definition-term">Liberal Imperialism</div>
<p>A framework for justifying colonial rule that argues coercion in the short term serves freedom in the long term — with the imperial power alone deciding when conditions are sufficient for self-governance to begin. Associated with Roosevelt's public defense of Philippine occupation: liberty requires order; order requires force; force in service of eventual freedom is regrettable but necessary. Critics identified the framework's fatal flaw immediately: it has no internal limiting principle. The timeline for "eventual freedom" can always be extended; the threshold for "readiness" can always be raised. What Roosevelt's logic could not self-correct, democratic institutions eventually did — through congressional legislation rather than imperial goodwill.</p>
