                <h3 style="color: var(--misty-sky);">The Progressive Invention of Sexual Modernity</h3>
                <p style="color: var(--morning-mist); font-style: italic; margin-top: 2em;">Chapter 21, Lecture 3</p>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>Welcome to Lecture 3</h4>
                    <p>This lecture examines how Progressives transformed sexuality from a subject of moral judgment into an object of scientific study and expert management. We'll explore how "knowing" about sex became a form of power and control.</p>
                    <h4>What makes this lecture important:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It shows how science and expertise can be tools of social control</li>
                        <li>It reveals the origins of modern sexual regulation through medical and legal authority</li>
                        <li>It introduces Margaret Sanger as a complex figure who both challenged and used Progressive sexual governance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Key theme to watch for:</h4>
                    <p>How sexual knowledge became power—the ability to define, categorize, and regulate intimate behavior.</p>
                </aside>

                <h2>From Policing to Explanation</h2>
                <p>Lecture 2 examined how <span class="key-term">fear and panic</span> turned sexuality into an object of policing</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">This lecture shifts the register again:</p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.3em; color: var(--pale-sunlight); margin-top: 1em;">If fear justified coercion, <span class="key-term">knowledge</span> justified authority</p>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>We're building on the last two lectures. Lecture 1 showed disgust leading to regulation. Lecture 2 showed fear leading to surveillance. Now we see how knowledge created a different kind of power.</p>
                    <h4>The progression:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Disgust</strong> → Protective regulation (food safety, workplace safety)</li>
                        <li><strong>Fear</strong> → Surveillance and policing (Mann Act, vice commissions)</li>
                        <li><strong>Knowledge</strong> → Expert authority and scientific management (this lecture)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why knowledge is powerful:</h4>
                    <p>When experts claim to understand something scientifically, they gain authority over it. If sex can be studied, measured, and explained, then experts can prescribe how people should behave.</p>
                    <h4>Discussion Prompt</h4>
                    <p>Who has authority over sexual behavior in our society today? Parents? Churches? Medical professionals? The law? How did we decide who gets to be an expert?</p>

            <!-- Progressive Beliefs -->
            <section>
                <h2>The Progressive Faith in Knowledge</h2>
                <p>Progressives increasingly believed that sexuality could be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Studied</li>
                    <li>Classified</li>
                    <li>Normalized</li>
                    <li>Improved</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This list represents a fundamental shift in thinking about sexuality. Before the Progressive Era, sexuality was primarily understood through religion and morality. Now it was becoming a subject of scientific study.</p>
                    <h4>What each term means:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Studied</strong>: Sexuality could be researched using scientific methods</li>
                        <li><strong>Classified</strong>: People could be sorted into categories (normal/abnormal, healthy/unhealthy)</li>
                        <li><strong>Normalized</strong>: Standards could be established for "normal" sexual behavior</li>
                        <li><strong>Improved</strong>: Through education and intervention, sexual behavior could be made "better"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why this shift mattered:</h4>
                    <p>Once sexuality was framed as a scientific problem, experts (doctors, social workers, psychologists) gained authority that previously belonged to religious leaders and families.</p>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>Michel Foucault</strong> argued that modern power operates not by forbidding things but by producing knowledge about them. The more we talk about, study, and classify sexuality, the more it becomes subject to regulation.</p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <div class="callout-title">Central Interpretive Claim</div>
                    <p>The Progressive Era did not simply repress sex</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0.5em;">It reorganized it—transforming sexuality into a modern social problem governed by <span class="key-term">experts, laws, and institutions</span></p>
                </div>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
                    <p>This is the key insight that will guide our entire lecture. Progressives weren't just saying "sex is bad"—they were creating entirely new systems for understanding and managing sexuality.</p>
                    <h4>What "reorganized" means:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sexuality moved from private to public concern</li>
                        <li>Authority shifted from families/churches to professionals/government</li>
                        <li>Moral judgment was replaced (or supplemented) by medical/scientific classification</li>
                        <li>New institutions were created to study, teach about, and regulate sex</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The modern sexual world:</h4>
                    <p>Many features of modern sexuality that we take for granted—sex education, birth control access, sexual medicine, legal definitions of consent—originated in Progressive-era attempts to manage sexuality "scientifically."</p>
                    <h4>Critical thinking:</h4>
                    <p>Is scientific management of sexuality better or worse than moral regulation? Or is it just a different form of control with different assumptions?</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Why Sex Became a Problem to Be Solved</h2>
                <p>Several developments destabilized older sexual norms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Urban anonymity and mobility</li>
                    <li>Wage labor for young men and women</li>
                    <li>Delayed marriage and declining parental supervision</li>
                    <li><span class="popup-trigger" onclick="togglePopup('leisure-popup')">Commercial leisure and dating culture</span></li>
                    <li>Immigration and racialized fears of difference</li>
                </ul>

                <div id="leisure-popup" class="popup">
                    <span class="popup-close" onclick="togglePopup('leisure-popup')">&times;</span>
                    <h3>Commercial Leisure and Dating Culture</h3>
                    <p><strong>Commercial leisure</strong>: Entertainment you pay for—dance halls, movie theaters, amusement parks, restaurants. This replaced older forms of socializing in homes and churches.</p>
                    <p><strong>Dating culture</strong>: A new pattern where young people socialized in public spaces, often one-on-one, without family supervision. This replaced older courtship rituals that happened in family parlors under parental watch.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why this worried reformers</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Young people could meet without family approval</li>
                        <li>Dating often involved spending money, creating unequal power dynamics</li>
                        <li>Public spaces like dance halls were seen as sexually charged</li>
                        <li>Working-class dating norms differed from middle-class expectations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>The result</strong>: Reformers sought to regulate commercial leisure spaces and educate young people about "proper" sexual behavior.</p>
                </div>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>These are the same structural changes we discussed in Lecture 2, but now we're seeing a different response: instead of just policing behavior, Progressives tried to study and explain it.</p>
                    <h4>Key Historical Context</h4>
                    <p>By the early 1900s, millions of young people were living in cities, working for wages, and socializing in public spaces. Traditional mechanisms of sexual regulation (family supervision, church authority, community gossip) were breaking down.</p>
                    <h4>Why this created a "problem":</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Old rules no longer worked in new social conditions</li>
                        <li>Different ethnic and class groups had different sexual norms</li>
                        <li>Young people had new freedoms but little guidance</li>
                        <li>Authorities feared social disorder and moral decline</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>John D'Emilio and Estelle Freedman</strong> in <em>Intimate Matters</em> (1988) show how the transition from a family-based economy to wage labor fundamentally transformed American sexuality. <strong>Beth Bailey</strong> in <em>From Front Porch to Back Seat</em> (1988) traces the emergence of modern dating culture.</p>

                    <h3>Sexuality as Social Risk</h3>
                    <p>When Progressives called sexuality a "social risk," they meant that private sexual behavior had public consequences:</p>
                    <p><strong>Perceived risks included:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Disease</strong>: Sexually transmitted infections (especially syphilis and gonorrhea)</li>
                        <li><strong>Illegitimacy</strong>: Children born outside marriage seen as burden on society</li>
                        <li><strong>Poverty</strong>: Large families seen as perpetuating poverty</li>
                        <li><strong>Degeneration</strong>: "Immoral" behavior thought to weaken the race/nation</li>
                        <li><strong>Social disorder</strong>: Fear that sexual freedom would undermine social stability</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>The logic</strong>: If private sexual behavior affects public welfare, then government has a right—even an obligation—to intervene.</p>

                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This slide explains why sexuality became a Progressive issue. It wasn't that sex was new—it was that the old ways of regulating it were breaking down.</p>
                    <h4>The shift in authority:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Before</strong>: Family elders, religious leaders, and tight-knit communities enforced sexual norms through personal relationships and social pressure</li>
                        <li><strong>After</strong>: These authorities lost power in anonymous urban settings, creating a vacuum that government and experts filled</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why "social risk" framing mattered:</h4>
                    <p>By framing sexuality as a social problem with public consequences (disease, poverty, social disorder), Progressives justified government intervention into private life. This was the same logic used for other reforms like public health and workplace safety.</p>
                    <h4>The pattern:</h4>
                    <p>Throughout Progressive reform, we see private behaviors being redefined as public problems: what you eat (food safety), where you work (labor regulation), how you raise your children (compulsory education), and who you have sex with.</p>
                    <h4>Discussion Prompt</h4>
                    <p>Where's the line between private behavior and public concern? Who decides?</p>

                    <h3>What Does "Epistemic" Mean?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Epistemic</strong>: Related to knowledge—how we know things, what counts as valid knowledge, who has authority to produce knowledge.</p>
                    <p><strong>An epistemic shift</strong>: A change in how knowledge is produced and validated.</p>
                    <p><strong>In this case</strong>: Sexuality shifted from being understood through religion and morality (where authority came from scripture and tradition) to being understood through science and medicine (where authority came from research and expertise).</p>
                    <p><strong>Why this matters</strong>: Who gets to define what's "normal," "healthy," or "proper" sexual behavior? This epistemic shift gave that power to doctors, social workers, and scientists rather than religious leaders and families.</p>

                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This slide describes a fundamental change in how Americans thought and talked about sexuality.</p>
                    <h4>Key Definitions</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Epistemic shift</strong>: A change in how knowledge is created and who has authority to create it</li>
                        <li><strong>Expert discourse</strong>: Specialized language and knowledge controlled by trained professionals</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The three movements:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>From taboo to topic</strong>: Sex became something people could discuss openly (in certain contexts)</li>
                        <li><strong>From private experience to expert discourse</strong>: Instead of learning about sex from family or experience, people increasingly got information from doctors, books, and lectures</li>
                        <li><strong>From moral judgment to medical explanation</strong>: Sexual behavior was increasingly explained in medical/scientific terms rather than purely moral terms</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What didn't change:</h4>
                    <p>Notice that moral assumptions didn't disappear—they were just repackaged in scientific language. What was called "sin" became "deviance" or "unhealthy." The judgments remained but claimed scientific neutrality.</p>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>Michel Foucault</strong> argues that the Victorian era wasn't actually silent about sex—it produced an explosion of discourse about sex, but channeled through medical and scientific language. The Progressive Era intensified this pattern.</p>

                    <h3>Early Sexology</h3>
                    <p><strong>Sexology</strong>: The scientific study of human sexuality, including sexual behavior, development, and relationships.</p>
                    <p><strong>Early sexologists</strong>: Researchers like Havelock Ellis, Magnus Hirschfeld, and (later) Alfred Kinsey who tried to study sexuality scientifically.</p>
                    <p><strong>What they did</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Collected case studies of sexual behavior</li>
                        <li>Created classification systems for sexual "types"</li>
                        <li>Studied sexual "deviance" and "normalcy"</li>
                        <li>Published research making sex a subject of scientific inquiry</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>The contradiction</strong>: While sexologists claimed scientific objectivity, their categories often reinforced existing moral judgments about what was "normal" or "healthy."</p>

                    <p>These are the institutions and practices through which sexual knowledge was created and distributed in the Progressive Era.</p>
                    <h4>Each arena explained:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Public health campaigns</strong>: Government efforts to educate about venereal disease, especially targeting military recruits and young people</li>
                        <li><strong>Hygiene lectures</strong>: Educational talks in schools, community centers, and workplaces about "proper" sexual behavior</li>
                        <li><strong>Medical textbooks</strong>: Professional literature that trained doctors to view sexuality as a medical issue</li>
                        <li><strong>Early sexology</strong>: Scientific research attempting to classify and explain sexual behavior</li>
                        <li><strong>Social work case files</strong>: Detailed records social workers kept about families' intimate lives</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What this created:</h4>
                    <p>A massive apparatus for producing, distributing, and controlling sexual knowledge. This wasn't just repression—it was the creation of entirely new forms of authority over sexuality.</p>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>Christina Simmons</strong> in <em>Making Marriage Modern</em> (2009) examines how sex education and marriage counseling emerged as professional fields in this era.</p>

                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This is the key analytical point. Scientific language gave reformers a way to regulate sexuality while claiming they weren't making moral judgments.</p>
                    <h4>How this worked:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Instead of saying "premarital sex is sinful," say "it's unhealthy"</li>
                        <li>Instead of saying "homosexuality is immoral," say "it's deviant" or "abnormal"</li>
                        <li>Instead of saying "women should be chaste," say "sexual restraint promotes wellness"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why scientific language was powerful:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It claimed objectivity and neutrality</li>
                        <li>It was harder to challenge (who can argue with "science"?)</li>
                        <li>It gave authority to professionals rather than ordinary people</li>
                        <li>It made moral judgments seem like natural facts</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The reality:</h4>
                    <p>Behind the scientific language, the same moral assumptions remained: heterosexuality was normal, marriage was proper, procreation was the purpose, etc. But now these assumptions were dressed up as medical facts.</p>
                    <h4>Why "sexual knowledge became a form of power":</h4>
                    <p>Whoever controls knowledge about sex—what's normal, healthy, proper—controls how people think about and manage their own sexuality. Doctors, social workers, and scientists gained enormous power over intimate life.</p>
                    <h4>Discussion Prompt</h4>
                    <p>Can science ever be truly neutral about sexuality? Or do scientists always bring moral assumptions to their research?</p>

                    <p>Once sexuality became an object of scientific study, experts began creating classification systems. These categories weren't neutral—they reflected and reinforced social hierarchies.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Healthy vs. unhealthy</strong>: Medical language replacing moral judgment—but often the same behaviors (premarital sex, masturbation, etc.) were labeled "unhealthy"</li>
                        <li><strong>Marital vs. illicit</strong>: Marriage remained the dividing line between acceptable and unacceptable sex</li>
                        <li><strong>Reproductive vs. wasteful</strong>: Sex for pleasure was seen as "wasteful"; sex should produce children</li>
                        <li><strong>Normal vs. deviant</strong>: Heterosexual, marital, procreative sex was "normal"; everything else was "deviant"</li>

                        <li>Black women stereotyped as hypersexual; white women as pure (with heavy consequences for those who violated expectations)</li>
                        <li>Women who desired sex labeled "nymphomaniacs"; men with high sex drives considered "virile"</li>

                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This slide bridges to next lecture on eugenics. Once experts created hierarchies of sexual behavior (normal/deviant, healthy/unhealthy), it was a short step to arguing that some people shouldn't reproduce.</p>
                    <h4>The progression:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sex becomes an object of expert knowledge</li>
                        <li>Experts create categories ranking sexual behavior</li>
                        <li>People are labeled based on their sexual behavior</li>
                        <li>Those labeled "deviant" or "unfit" are targeted for intervention</li>
                        <li>Eventually, this extends to preventing "unfit" people from reproducing</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>The logic:</h4>
                    <p>If some sexual behavior is "unhealthy" or "deviant," and if experts can identify who engages in such behavior, then perhaps society should prevent those people from passing on their traits. This is eugenic logic emerging from Progressive sexual regulation.</p>
                    <h4>Why this matters:</h4>
                    <p>It shows how eugenics didn't come out of nowhere. It emerged logically from Progressive assumptions about expertise, social efficiency, and the right to manage populations for the collective good.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">Progressive-era law treated sexual information as:</p>

                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This is a paradox: while Progressives promoted expert knowledge about sex, they also heavily censored sexual information available to ordinary people.</p>
                    <h4>The logic:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Experts</strong> could study sex because they were trained and objective</li>
                        <li><strong>Ordinary people</strong> couldn't be trusted with sexual information because they might misuse it</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What was considered "dangerous":</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Information about contraception</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h4>The double standard:</h4>
                    <p>Medical textbooks could discuss sexuality in clinical terms, but popular materials about sex were banned as "obscene." This created a knowledge hierarchy where only professionals had access to information.</p>

                    <h3>The Comstock Laws</h3>
                    <p><strong>Anthony Comstock</strong>: A moral crusader who led the fight against "obscenity" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
                    <p><strong>Comstock Act (1873)</strong>: Federal law that made it illegal to send "obscene, lewd, or lascivious" materials through the mail. This included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pornography</li>
                        <li>Information about contraception</li>
                        <li>Sex education materials</li>
                        <li>Advertisements for birth control</li>
                        <li>Anything Comstock deemed "immoral"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Enforcement</strong>: Comstock became a special agent with power to open mail and arrest violators. He personally destroyed tons of materials and arrested thousands of people.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact</strong>: Made it effectively illegal to distribute information about birth control, even to married couples. This is why Margaret Sanger's activism was so radical—and criminal.</p>
                </div>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>The government didn't just regulate sexual behavior—it regulated what people could know about sex.</p>
                    <h4>Each mechanism explained:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Obscenity statutes</strong>: Laws defining "obscene" materials as illegal. These were interpreted broadly to include educational materials about sex.</li>
                        <li><strong>Censorship of contraceptive information</strong>: It was illegal to mail, sell, or distribute information about birth control</li>
                        <li><strong>Postal regulation</strong>: The U.S. Post Office had enormous power to determine what could be mailed, and used it aggressively to suppress sexual information</li>
                        <li><strong>Criminalization of sexual education</strong>: Teaching about contraception or sexual health could result in criminal prosecution</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The Comstock Era:</h4>
                    <p>From 1873 through the 1930s, federal obscenity laws (the Comstock Acts) made it illegal to distribute contraceptive information or devices through the mail. Many states had additional laws criminalizing the sale or use of contraception.</p>
                    <h4>Who this affected:</h4>
                    <p>Primarily poor and working-class people who couldn't afford private doctors (who sometimes provided contraception discreetly to wealthy patients). Knowledge became a class privilege.</p>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>Andrea Tone</strong> in <em>Devices and Desires</em> (2001) chronicles the history of contraception in America and how censorship created a black market for birth control devices.</p>

                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This is a crucial insight: controlling knowledge is a form of power. By deciding who can access information about sexuality, authorities controlled people's ability to make informed choices.</p>
                    <h4>Why "ignorance as protection" mattered:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Authorities argued that sexual information would "corrupt" young people and women</li>
                        <li>They claimed ignorance preserved innocence</li>
                        <li>They believed knowledge would encourage sexual experimentation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The reality:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ignorance didn't prevent sexual activity—it just made it more dangerous</li>
                        <li>Without information about contraception, women faced unwanted pregnancies</li>
                        <li>Without information about disease, people couldn't protect themselves</li>
                        <li>Censorship created a knowledge gap that harmed the most vulnerable</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The pattern:</h4>
                    <p>Throughout Progressive reform, we see paternalism: authorities claiming they know what's best for people and restricting autonomy "for their own good." This happened with sexual knowledge, alcohol (Prohibition), immigration (Americanization), and more.</p>
                    <h4>Discussion Prompt</h4>
                    <p>When is ignorance protection, and when is it disempowerment? Should any information be censored "for people's own good"?</p>

                    <p>Margaret Sanger (1879-1966) was a nurse and birth control activist who founded what became Planned Parenthood. But she was also a controversial figure whose methods and alliances raise difficult questions.</p>
                    <h4>Key Definitions</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Margaret Sanger</strong>: Nurse, birth control activist, founder of the American Birth Control League (later Planned Parenthood)</li>
                        <li><strong>Birth control</strong>: Sanger coined this term to replace "contraception" because it emphasized women's control</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Sanger's background:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Born 1879 in Corning, New York, to a large working-class Irish Catholic family</li>
                        <li>Trained as a nurse</li>
                        <li>Worked on New York's Lower East Side among poor immigrant families</li>
                        <li>Witnessed women dying from botched abortions and exhaustion from constant childbearing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What she observed:</h4>
                    <p>Poor women trapped in cycles of pregnancy, childbirth, and poverty. They desperately wanted to control their fertility but had no access to contraception. Middle-class women could sometimes get contraception from private doctors, but poor women were left ignorant and vulnerable.</p>
                    <h4>Her famous story:</h4>
                    <p>Sanger claimed a patient named Sadie Sachs died after a botched abortion because doctors refused to tell her how to prevent pregnancy. This motivated Sanger's activism. (Historians debate whether this story is true or a compelling narrative Sanger used to explain her activism.)</p>

                    <h4>What "epistemic intervention" means:</h4>
                    <p>Sanger challenged the knowledge system itself. She argued:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Information about contraception wasn't "obscene"—it was essential health information</li>
                        <li>Women weren't corrupted by sexual knowledge—they were empowered by it</li>
                        <li>Experts shouldn't monopolize information—ordinary people needed access</li>
                        <li>The government shouldn't decide what women could know about their own bodies</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Her tactics:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Published <em>The Woman Rebel</em> magazine with contraceptive information</li>
                        <li>Opened birth control clinics (first in Brooklyn, 1916)</li>
                        <li>Deliberately violated Comstock laws to challenge them in court</li>
                        <li>Traveled internationally to study contraceptive methods</li>
                        <li>Built a movement to legalize birth control</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The risks:</h4>
                    <p>Sanger was arrested multiple times, faced prison, and lived in exile for a period. Her clinics were raided and shut down. But publicity from arrests built support for her cause.</p>

                    <li>She challenged sexual silence</li>
                    <li>She invoked science and health</li>

                    <h3>Sanger and Eugenic Language</h3>
                    <p><strong>The tension</strong>: Sanger fought for women's reproductive autonomy, but sometimes used eugenic arguments to build support.</p>
                    <p><strong>Eugenic arguments she used</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Birth control would allow "better" families to thrive</li>
                        <li>Limiting reproduction among the "unfit" would improve society</li>
                        <li>Population quality mattered as much as quantity</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why she did this</strong>: Eugenic arguments were persuasive to Progressive reformers and potential supporters. By framing birth control as scientific and socially beneficial, Sanger tried to overcome moral objections.</p>
                    <p><strong>The problem</strong>: This rhetoric could be (and was) used to justify coercive population control, especially targeting poor people, people of color, and disabled people.</p>
                    <p><strong>Historical debate</strong>: Scholars debate whether Sanger was primarily motivated by women's autonomy or by eugenic improvement. The evidence suggests both motives coexisted uneasily.</p>

                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>Sanger is a complicated historical figure. She did important work expanding reproductive access, but she also used problematic eugenic arguments.</p>
                    <h4>The three tensions:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Challenged sexual silence</strong>: This was radical and necessary—breaking taboos about discussing sexuality and reproduction</li>
                        <li><strong>Invoked science and health</strong>: This was strategic—using Progressive language to build legitimacy</li>
                        <li><strong>Adopted eugenic language</strong>: This was problematic—reinforcing hierarchies of human worth</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why historians emphasize these tensions:</h4>
                    <p>Sanger shows that even progressive activists operated within the assumptions of their era. She challenged some aspects of Progressive sexual regulation (censorship, ignorance) while accepting others (expert authority, eugenic logic).</p>
                    <h4>The eugenic dimension:</h4>
                    <p>Sanger sometimes argued birth control would prevent the "unfit" from reproducing. She spoke to eugenic conferences. She accepted funding from eugenics supporters. This deeply complicates her legacy, especially given how birth control was later used coercively.</p>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>Linda Gordon</strong> in <em>Woman's Body, Woman's Right</em> (1976) provides a nuanced account of Sanger's activism and its contradictions. <strong>Betsy Hartmann</strong> and others have critiqued how population control movements have targeted marginalized communities.</p>
                    <h4>Discussion Prompt</h4>
                    <p>Can we appreciate Sanger's work for reproductive access while criticizing her eugenic rhetoric? How do we evaluate historical figures who did both liberating and oppressive things?</p>

                    <div class="callout-title">Interpretive Claim</div>
                    <p>Sanger did not stand outside Progressive sexual governance</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0.5em;">She <span class="key-term">contested it from within</span>, using its tools while resisting its constraints</p>
                </div>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This is the key interpretive point about Sanger. She wasn't a complete outsider attacking the system—she was working within Progressive assumptions while trying to expand reproductive autonomy.</p>
                    <h4>What "contested from within" means:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>She accepted the Progressive emphasis on expertise and science</li>
                        <li>She claimed authority as a trained nurse and health professional</li>
                        <li>She used eugenic arguments that resonated with reformers</li>
                        <li>But she challenged censorship, paternalism, and male control over reproduction</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why this matters:</h4>
                    <p>It shows how change happens—usually not from complete outsiders, but from people working within existing systems who push boundaries and challenge specific constraints. Sanger accepted some Progressive assumptions while rejecting others.</p>
                    <h4>The broader pattern:</h4>
                    <p>Many progressive activists of this era used the tools of Progressive reform (expertise, science, government intervention) while contesting who wielded those tools and to what ends. This created both progress and new forms of control.</p>

                    <p>Progressive sexual reform produced both liberation and control simultaneously. This is the central contradiction.</p>
                    <h4>The progressive side:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Expanding knowledge</strong>: More information about sexuality available (though controlled by experts)</li>
                        <li><strong>Greater autonomy</strong>: Women gaining some control over reproduction</li>
                        <li><strong>Challenging censorship</strong>: Activists like Sanger pushing back against Comstock laws</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The controlling side:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Persistent regulation</strong>: Government and experts still controlling sexual behavior</li>
                        <li><strong>Unequal access</strong>: Knowledge and contraception available to middle-class people but not poor people</li>
                        <li><strong>Racialized judgments</strong>: Birth control encouraged for "unfit" populations but restricted for "fit" populations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why both things happened at once:</h4>
                    <p>Progressive reform expanded some freedoms while creating new forms of control. The same movement that gave women access to contraception also created systems for judging who should and shouldn't reproduce.</p>
                    <h4>Discussion Prompt</h4>
                    <p>Is reproductive autonomy possible when experts control access to knowledge and technology? What would true autonomy look like?</p>

                    <p>Modern sexual freedom didn't simply emerge—it was fought for, contested, and always incomplete.</p>
                    <h4>What "sexual modernity" means:</h4>
                    <ul>

                    <h4>Why it was "contested":</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Religious and moral conservatives opposed sexual liberalization</li>
                        <li>Medical establishment wanted to control access</li>
                        <li>Government enforced censorship and restrictions</li>
                        <li>Activists pushed for expanded access and knowledge</li>
                        <li>Different communities had different norms and needs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What "partial, uneven, constantly negotiated" means:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Partial</strong>: Some autonomy gained but within limits</li>
                        <li><strong>Uneven</strong>: Available to some people (privileged) but not others (marginalized)</li>
                        <li><strong>Constantly negotiated</strong>: Ongoing struggle, not a final victory</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The takeaway:</h4>
                    <p>Sexual freedom and autonomy are always works in progress, shaped by ongoing struggles between different visions of how sexuality should be organized.</p>

                <p>By the 1910s:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sexuality had been medicalized</li>
                    <li>Reproduction had been politicized</li>
                    <li>Bodies had been categorized</li>
                    <li>Experts had gained authority</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>Everything we've discussed in this lecture created the conditions for eugenics to emerge as policy.</p>
                    <h4>How each development enabled eugenics:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sexuality medicalized</strong>: Doctors claimed authority over reproduction</li>
                        <li><strong>Reproduction politicized</strong>: Government claimed interest in who reproduced</li>
                        <li><strong>Bodies categorized</strong>: People sorted into "fit" and "unfit"</li>
                        <li><strong>Experts gained authority</strong>: Professionals could override individual choice</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The logic:</h4>
                    <p>If sexuality is a matter of public health, if experts can identify "unhealthy" or "unfit" sexuality, if reproduction affects social welfare, then perhaps society should prevent "unfit" people from reproducing. This is how eugenics became thinkable.</p>

                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This slide explains how the logic of this lecture leads directly into eugenics. Once reproduction is framed as a social problem requiring expert management, forced sterilization becomes thinkable.</p>
                    <h4>The progression across lectures:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lecture 2</strong>: Fear justifies surveillance and policing of sexual behavior</li>
                        <li><strong>Lecture 3</strong>: Knowledge creates expert authority over sexuality and reproduction</li>
                        <li><strong>Lecture 4</strong>: Experts use that authority to prevent "unfit" people from reproducing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why this matters:</h4>
                    <p>It shows that eugenics didn't emerge from nowhere. It was a logical extension of Progressive assumptions about expertise, efficiency, and the right to manage populations for collective welfare.</p>
                    <h4>The warning:</h4>
                    <p>When we allow experts to define who is "fit" or "unfit," and when we prioritize social efficiency over individual rights, we create conditions for profound injustice.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">It transformed sex into:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A public concern</li>
                    <li>A scientific object</li>

                    <p>Modern sexual freedom emerged not in opposition to Progressivism, but through <span class="key-term">prolonged struggle within it</span></p>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This is the summary of our entire argument about Progressive sexual regulation.</p>
                    <h4>The four transformations:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Public concern</strong>: Sexual behavior no longer seen as purely private</li>
                        <li><strong>Scientific object</strong>: Sexuality became something to study and classify</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal category</strong>: Law defined acceptable and unacceptable sexuality</li>
                        <li><strong>Site of state power</strong>: Government claimed authority over intimate life</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The final insight:</h4>
                    <p>"Modern sexual freedom emerged not in opposition to Progressivism, but through prolonged struggle within it." This means:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The sexual freedoms we have today were fought for by people working within Progressive systems</li>
                        <li>Those systems both enabled and constrained liberation</li>
                        <li>The struggle is ongoing—we still negotiate between autonomy and regulation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Looking forward:</h4>
                    <p>Next lecture will show the darkest outcome of Progressive sexual governance: eugenics and forced sterilization. This will complete our understanding of how Progressive faith in expertise and efficiency could produce both protection and coercion.</p>
