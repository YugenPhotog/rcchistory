<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
This slide introduces you to Jacob Riis and the problem he set out to solve. The key distinction here is between <em>individual rescue</em> and <em>structural reform</em>. By the 1880s, organizations like the SPCC (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children) existed — they could remove specific children from abusive homes. But they couldn't fix the <em>systems</em> that endangered children in the first place: the tenements, the poverty, the lack of parks, the child labor. Riis aimed at those systems.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Breaking It Down</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Riis" target="_blank">Jacob Riis</a></strong> was born in Ribe, Denmark, in 1849 — the third of fifteen children. He emigrated to America in 1870 at age twenty-one with no specific plan and no money. He spent his first years in the United States in grinding poverty, sleeping in police station lodging houses and taking whatever work he could find. That experience shaped everything he did later — when he eventually became a police reporter for the <em>New York Tribune</em> (1877–1888) and then the <em>Evening Sun</em> (1888–1899), he brought a personal understanding of what poverty felt like.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
<strong>The Mary Ellen Wilson connection</strong>: In 1874, a landmark case had led to the creation of the SPCC — the first agency in the world with police powers to remove abused children from homes. That was a genuine breakthrough. But more than a decade later, when Riis started walking through those same tenement neighborhoods with a camera, the children were still there. Not necessarily being beaten by parents — but sleeping on street grates, crowded into airless rooms, working in sweatshops. The SPCC could rescue individual children from bad situations. It couldn't change the environment that endangered <em>all</em> children.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
<strong>The structural insight</strong>: This is the crucial shift in thinking. Before Riis, the question was: "Which parents are neglecting their children?" After Riis, the question became: "How can <em>any</em> parent raise children in these conditions?" That reframing — from individual moral failure to systemic problem — fundamentally changed how Americans thought about poverty and reform.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
Riis represents a turning point in American reform: the shift from charity (helping individuals) to structural reform (changing systems). This is the same template that Progressive reformers will use in the early 1900s — investigate, document, expose, demand systemic change. Understanding Riis helps you see where that template came from and why it was so powerful.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">🎓 Historians Weigh In</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: 1em;">Bonnie Yochelson & Daniel Czitrom – <em>Rediscovering Jacob Riis</em></h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
Yochelson and Czitrom argue that Riis was more complex than his reputation suggests. He was not just a sympathetic humanitarian — he was also a product of his time, carrying assumptions about race, ethnicity, and respectability that shaped what he chose to photograph and how he described what he saw. His photographs of Italian, Jewish, and Chinese immigrants sometimes reinforced stereotypes even as they generated sympathy. Understanding Riis means holding both truths at once: his work was genuinely groundbreaking <em>and</em> it reflected the biases of Gilded Age reform culture.

      <!-- ========== SLIDE 2: Flash Powder Photography ========== -->
      <section>
        <h1>Revolutionary and Dangerous: Flash Powder Photography</h1>
        
        <div class="two-column">
          <div>
            <h3>The Technology of Exposure</h3>
            <p><strong>Flash powder</strong> = magnesium + potassium chlorate</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ignited by match → explosive flash, choking smoke</li>
              <li>Available only since mid-1880s</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Risks</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Set at least 2 documented fires</li>
              <li>Blew out windows</li>
              <li>Terrified subjects</li>
              <li>Sometimes chased from buildings</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
              <strong>Why it mattered:</strong> First time windowless interior rooms could be photographed — spaces middle-class Americans had never seen.
            </div>

            <div class="conclusion-box" style="margin-top:20px;">
              The worst conditions were in rooms with no windows, no light — spaces that had literally <em>never been photographed</em> before Riis.
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <aside class="notes">
<div style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
This slide is about technology as a tool for social change — and the physical risks Riis took to make invisible conditions visible. The flash powder was crude, dangerous, and absolutely essential. Without it, the darkest corners of tenement life would have remained literally unseen.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Breaking It Down</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_(photography)" target="_blank">Flash powder</a></strong> was a mixture of magnesium powder and potassium chlorate. When ignited with a match, it produced a brilliant explosive flash — and thick, choking smoke that filled whatever room Riis was photographing. This technology had only become available in the mid-1880s, which is part of why Riis's work was possible <em>when</em> it was. The camera existed before; the ability to photograph dark interiors did not.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
<strong>The process was dramatic and dangerous</strong>. Riis would enter tenements late at night, often accompanied by police officers. His assistant would hold a pan of flash powder, Riis would open the camera shutter, the assistant would touch the powder with a match — BOOM — a brilliant flash, then acrid smoke filling the room. He set at least two documented fires in tenement buildings. He blew out windows. Residents, terrified by what sounded like explosions, sometimes chased Riis and his team out of buildings. In lodging houses, sleeping men scattered in panic, thinking it was a police raid.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
<strong>Why this mattered</strong>: The worst tenement conditions were in interior rooms with no windows and no natural light. These were spaces that SPCC investigators might never see — they'd interview a family in the front room during the day and never enter the airless sleeping quarters in back where children actually lived. Riis's flash powder made it possible, for the first time, to photograph these spaces and show them to a middle-class audience that had no idea they existed.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
There's a powerful metaphor built into this technology: the physical danger of the flash powder mirrored the social danger of exposure. Society didn't want to see these conditions any more than tenement residents wanted photographers exploding flash powder in their rooms at midnight. Making the invisible visible is never comfortable — it requires tools, courage, and a willingness to create disruption. Think about this: what are the "flash powder" equivalents today? What technologies or methods are people using right now to expose conditions that powerful institutions would prefer to keep hidden?

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
This video recreates what Riis's audiences experienced: a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_lantern" target="_blank">magic lantern</a></strong> slide show — the 1890s equivalent of a PowerPoint presentation. Riis would stand in a darkened hall, project his photographs onto a screen using a device that illuminated glass slides, and narrate what he had seen. Audiences who had never set foot in a tenement were suddenly looking into rooms where families of ten slept in spaces the size of a closet, where children worked in sweatshops, where the homeless slept in police station basements.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Breaking It Down</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
Watch carefully for the <strong>combination of image and narrative</strong>. Riis didn't just show pictures — he told stories. He gave names, ages, addresses. He described smells, sounds, temperatures. The power of his presentations came from pairing the visual shock of the photographs with the human details that made viewers see tenement residents as real people, not abstract statistics.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
Also notice the <strong>audience</strong> Riis was targeting: middle-class and upper-class Americans who had the political power to demand reform but had never personally witnessed the conditions he documented. His strategy was the same one muckraking journalists and Progressive reformers would later adopt: show comfortable Americans what their comfort concealed.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
Riis pioneered multimedia advocacy more than a century before social media. His magic lantern lectures combined photography, storytelling, and live performance to create an emotional experience that moved audiences to action. When you encounter Lewis Hine's child labor photographs in your HIST 102 course, you'll see the direct continuation of this method — visual evidence deployed strategically to generate political pressure.

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">📖 Understanding This Slide</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
This final slide pulls together Riis's impact and legacy. The highlight box at the top captures the most important idea in this entire module: Riis changed the <em>question</em>. Before him, child welfare was about rescuing individual children from bad parents. After him, it was about changing the systems that made childhood dangerous for everyone in certain neighborhoods.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Breaking It Down</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
<strong>The reframing</strong>: Read the highlight box carefully. "Which parents are neglecting their children?" puts the blame on individuals. "How can any parent raise children in these conditions?" puts the blame on systems — housing policy, urban planning, labor regulation, public investment. That shift from individual moral failure to structural analysis is one of the most important intellectual moves in the history of American reform. It's the foundation of the entire Progressive movement you'll study in HIST 102.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
<strong>Concrete reforms</strong>: Riis's work contributed directly to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Tenement_House_Act" target="_blank">Tenement House Act of 1901</a>, which mandated ventilation, sanitation, and fire safety standards in New York tenements. He personally campaigned for parks and playgrounds in tenement districts — and was credited by city officials with making several of them happen. His exposure of children sleeping on streets and working in sweatshops built momentum for child labor regulation. His friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt" target="_blank">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, then New York's Police Commissioner, read <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_the_Other_Half_Lives" target="_blank">How the Other Half Lives</a></em> and immediately went to Riis's office to volunteer his help. Roosevelt later said Riis was "the best American I ever knew."
</p>

<strong>Photography's power</strong>: Think about what a photograph can do that a statistic cannot. A statistic tells you that 290,000 people lived per square mile in the Lower East Side. A photograph shows you a family of ten sleeping in a room the size of a closet. Both convey information — but the photograph generates an emotional response that drives political action. Riis understood this instinctively: seeing would be believing.

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
<strong>The legacy line to Lewis Hine</strong>: In 1908, a sociologist-turned-photographer named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hine" target="_blank">Lewis Hine</a> was hired by the National Child Labor Committee to do for child labor what Riis had done for tenement conditions. Hine traveled the country photographing children in mills, mines, canneries, and farms — building directly on the method Riis pioneered. Settlement houses like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_House" target="_blank">Hull House</a> adopted similar methods of investigation and documentation. The entire Progressive reform template — investigate, document, expose, demand structural change — traces back to what Riis did with a camera and a pan of flash powder in the late 1880s.

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">Why This Matters</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
Riis changed American reform in two fundamental ways. First, he demonstrated that photography could be a tool for social change — not just art or journalism, but <em>evidence</em> deployed strategically to generate political pressure. Second, he shifted the conversation from individual rescue to structural reform. The children he photographed weren't just victims of bad parents — they were victims of bad systems. That insight fundamentally changed how Americans understood poverty, childhood, and the government's responsibility to its citizens. It's the intellectual foundation of everything you'll study in the Progressive Era.

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
As you think about this, consider a question that still matters today: <strong>Who is doing this work now? Who is making invisible problems visible?</strong> What are the "flash powder" technologies of our time — the tools that expose conditions powerful people would prefer to keep hidden?

<h3 style="color: #2c5282; margin-top: 1.5em;">🎓 Historians Weigh In</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: 1em;">Bonnie Yochelson & Daniel Czitrom – <em>Rediscovering Jacob Riis</em></h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
Yochelson and Czitrom remind us that Riis was both a pioneer and a man of his time. His photographs genuinely changed policy — but they also sometimes reinforced ethnic stereotypes. He described Jewish, Italian, and Chinese immigrants in terms that reflected the prejudices of his era. Understanding Riis means appreciating his extraordinary achievement while also recognizing its limits. He made invisible problems visible — but he saw those problems through the lens of a white, Protestant, middle-class reformer who believed his values were universal.
</p>
<h4 style="margin-top: 1em;">Tom Buk-Swienty – <em>The Other Half: The Life of Jacob Riis and the World of Immigrant America</em></h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
Buk-Swienty's biography emphasizes Riis's own immigrant experience as central to his work. Unlike most Gilded Age reformers, Riis had personally experienced poverty, homelessness, and the dehumanizing conditions of police lodging houses. That personal knowledge gave his advocacy an authenticity that resonated with audiences — he wasn't just observing the poor; he had been one of them. But his desire to prove himself as a "real American" also meant he sometimes distanced himself from newer immigrants in ways that reinforced the very hierarchies he was trying to dismantle.
