                <p style="color: var(--morning-mist); font-style: italic; margin-top: 2em;">Chapter 21, Lecture 2</p>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>Welcome to Lecture 2</h4>
                    <p>This lecture examines one of the most controversial aspects of Progressive reform: the regulation of sexuality and personal behavior. We'll explore how moral fears and anxieties about urban life, immigration, and women's independence led to new forms of government surveillance and control.</p>
                    <h4>What makes this lecture important:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It shows the coercive side of Progressive reform</li>
                        <li>It reveals how moral panic becomes a tool of governance</li>
                        <li>It connects to ongoing debates about government power and personal freedom</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Key theme to watch for:</h4>
                    <p>How "protection" often became a justification for punishment and control, especially targeting women, immigrants, and people of color.</p>

                <p>Lecture 1 examined how <span class="key-term">disgust</span> mobilized Progressive reform</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">This lecture shifts emotional register:</p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.3em; color: var(--pale-sunlight); margin-top: 1em;">If disgust produced regulation, <span class="key-term">fear</span> produced surveillance</p>

                    <h3>Disgust vs. Fear as Reform Motivators</h3>
                    <p><strong>Disgust</strong> (Lecture 1): Responses to contaminated food, unsafe working conditions, unsanitary conditions in cities. Led to protective regulation like the Pure Food and Drug Act.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fear</strong> (This lecture): Anxieties about sexuality, women's independence, immigration, and social disorder. Led to surveillance, policing, and criminalization.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key difference</strong>: Disgust focused on protecting consumers from tangible threats. Fear focused on controlling behavior and enforcing moral norms.</p>
                </div>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>We're building on last lecture's themes. In Lecture 1, we saw how Progressives responded to visceral disgust about food contamination and industrial dangers by creating regulations to protect people. This lecture shows a different response: fear.</p>
                    <h4>Key Definitions</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Disgust</strong>: An emotional response to contamination or impurity that motivated protective regulation</li>
                        <li><strong>Fear</strong>: Anxiety about social disorder, moral decline, or loss of control that motivated surveillance and punishment</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Context & Connections</h4>
                    <p>Both emotions motivated reform, but with very different outcomes. Disgust led to consumer protection. Fear led to invasive policing of private behavior. This reveals the double-edged nature of Progressive reform: it could protect OR control, depending on what motivated it.</p>
                    <h4>Discussion Prompt</h4>
                    <p>Can you think of contemporary examples where fear (rather than evidence) drives policy? How does that affect who gets targeted?</p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <div class="callout-title">Central Interpretive Claim</div>
                    <p>The Progressive Era did not simply repress sexuality</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0.5em;">It made sex a <span class="key-term">public danger</span> that justified new forms of state power</p>
                </div>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
                    <p>This is the key insight for understanding this entire lecture. Progressives didn't just say "sex is bad." They transformed sexuality into a social problem that required government intervention.</p>
                    <h4>What this means:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sex became something the government had a right to regulate</li>
                        <li>Private behavior became a public concern</li>
                        <li>New forms of surveillance and policing were justified as necessary for social order</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>Michel Foucault</strong> argued that modern societies don't just repress sexuality—they make it an object of constant discussion, study, and regulation. The Progressive Era is a perfect example of this process in American history.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Why Sex Became a Public Crisis</h2>
                <p>Several <span class="popup-trigger" onclick="togglePopup('structural-popup')">structural changes</span> converged in the early 20th century:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Young women working outside the home</li>
                    <li>Delayed marriage</li>
                    <li>Urban anonymity</li>
                    <li>Immigrant neighborhoods outside moral oversight</li>
                    <li>Commercial leisure culture (dance halls, theaters, amusement parks)</li>
                </ul>

                <div id="structural-popup" class="popup">
                    <span class="popup-close" onclick="togglePopup('structural-popup')">&times;</span>
                    <h3>Structural Changes in American Society</h3>
                    <p><strong>Structural changes</strong> are large-scale shifts in how society is organized—changes in the economy, family structure, where people live, how they work.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why this matters</strong>: These weren't just individual moral choices. The entire social organization of American life was transforming:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Economic</strong>: More wage work, less family production</li>
                        <li><strong>Demographic</strong>: Cities growing rapidly, immigration surging</li>
                        <li><strong>Cultural</strong>: New forms of entertainment and socializing</li>
                        <li><strong>Gender</strong>: Women gaining independence from family supervision</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These changes made traditional forms of moral regulation (family, church, community) less effective.</p>
                </div>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This is about CONTEXT, not morality. Before judging Progressive responses, understand what was changing in American society.</p>
                    <h4>Key Historical Context</h4>
                    <p><strong>Before 1890s</strong>: Most Americans lived in rural areas or small towns where everyone knew everyone. Young people were supervised by family and church. Marriage happened early.</p>
                    <p><strong>After 1890s</strong>: Millions moved to cities. Young women worked in factories, stores, and offices. People socialized in public spaces without family supervision. Marriage was delayed as people worked for wages.</p>
                    <h4>Why this threatened traditional authorities</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Parents couldn't supervise daughters in factories or stores</li>
                        <li>Churches had less influence in anonymous urban neighborhoods</li>
                        <li>Young people had money to spend on entertainment</li>
                        <li>Traditional courtship rituals broke down</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>Kathy Peiss</strong> in <em>Cheap Amusements</em> (1986) shows how working-class young women created new forms of heterosocial leisure in early 20th century cities, often trading sexual favors for treats from male companions in a practice called "treating." This terrified middle-class reformers.</p>
                    <h4>Discussion Prompt</h4>
                    <p>What forms of technology or social change today make parents anxious about young people's behavior? How is that similar to or different from Progressive-era anxieties?</p>

                    <div class="callout-title">Interpretive Claim</div>
                    <p>Progressives increasingly understood sexual behavior as a <span class="key-term">threat to social order</span>, not merely a moral failing</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">This reframing transformed sex into a legitimate object of <span class="popup-trigger" onclick="togglePopup('governance-popup')">governance</span></p>

                    <h3>Governance vs. Moral Judgment</h3>
                    <p><strong>Moral judgment</strong>: "This behavior is sinful" → handled by churches, families</p>
                    <p><strong>Governance</strong>: "This behavior threatens public welfare" → handled by government, law, institutions</p>
                    <p><strong>Why the shift matters</strong>: Once sex was framed as a public threat rather than a private sin, it became appropriate for state intervention. The government claimed authority over intimate life.</p>
                    <p><strong>Modern parallel</strong>: Think about debates over whether drug use is a moral failing (requiring punishment) or a public health issue (requiring treatment). The frame determines the response.</p>

                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>William Novak</strong> in <em>The People's Welfare</em> (1996) shows how American governments have always regulated private behavior when it was seen as affecting public welfare. This wasn't new—but the scale and methods expanded dramatically in the Progressive Era.</p>
                    <h4>Critical thinking question</h4>
                    <p>Who benefits when private behavior is redefined as a public threat? Who is harmed? Pay attention to who gets targeted for regulation.</p>

                <p>The "<span class="popup-trigger" onclick="togglePopup('white-slave-popup')">white-slave</span>" panic functioned less as accurate description and more as <span class="key-term">moral storytelling</span></p>

                    <h3>The "White Slavery" Narrative</h3>
                    <p><strong>The story reformers told</strong>: Innocent young white women were being kidnapped or tricked by predatory men (often portrayed as foreign or non-white) and forced into prostitution.</p>
                    <p><strong>The reality</strong>: While coerced prostitution existed, most women entered sex work due to economic necessity, not kidnapping. The panic vastly exaggerated the scale of "trafficking."</p>
                    <p><strong>Why the name "white slavery"</strong>: By invoking slavery, reformers suggested something as horrific as chattel slavery was happening to white women. This racialized language was intentional—it played on fears about racial boundaries and white women's purity.</p>
                    <p><strong>What the panic revealed</strong>: More about Progressive anxieties than about actual patterns of prostitution.</p>

                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>The "white-slave panic" was a moral panic—an exaggerated fear about a social problem that reveals deeper cultural anxieties.</p>
                    <h4>Key Definitions</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>White slavery</strong>: Progressive-era term for forced prostitution, especially of white women</li>
                        <li><strong>Moral panic</strong>: An exaggerated societal fear about a perceived threat to social order</li>
                        <li><strong>Moral storytelling</strong>: Narratives that simplify complex issues into clear tales of innocence threatened and evil to be defeated</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why this was a "panic" rather than accurate reporting</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stories were sensationalized and often fabricated</li>
                        <li>Scale was vastly exaggerated</li>
                        <li>Most prostitution was driven by poverty, not kidnapping</li>
                        <li>Women who chose sex work were ignored or blamed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>Ruth Rosen</strong> in <em>The Lost Sisterhood</em> (1982) shows that most Progressive-era prostitutes entered sex work due to economic desperation, not coercion. <strong>David Langum</strong> and others have documented how the "white slavery" narrative bore little resemblance to actual prostitution patterns.</p>
                    <h4>Discussion Prompt</h4>
                    <p>Can you think of contemporary moral panics? What anxieties do they reveal about our own society?</p>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>Notice the pattern here: every element reinforces a loss of control. Parents can't protect daughters. Cities are dangerous. Evil men prey on innocence. This narrative justified expanding government power.</p>
                    <h4>What these elements reveal about Progressive anxieties:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Innocent girls</strong>: Fear that women were too naive for urban independence</li>
                        <li><strong>Predatory men</strong>: Often portrayed as foreign or non-white, revealing racial anxieties</li>
                        <li><strong>Dangerous cities</strong>: Urban life itself seen as morally corrupting</li>
                        <li><strong>Corrupt vice networks</strong>: Belief in organized criminal conspiracies</li>
                        <li><strong>Helpless families</strong>: Traditional authorities losing power to govern behavior</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Critical thinking</h4>
                    <p>Notice who has agency in this story: predatory men. Notice who doesn't: women. This framing denied women's ability to make choices (even bad ones) and justified paternalistic "protection."</p>

            <!-- What the Panic Revealed -->
            <section>
                <h2>What the Panic Revealed</h2>
                <p>The panic expressed fears about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="popup-trigger" onclick="togglePopup('immigration-popup')">Immigration</span></li>

                    <li>Loss of parental control</li>
                </ul>

                <div id="immigration-popup" class="popup">
                    <span class="popup-close" onclick="togglePopup('immigration-popup')">&times;</span>
                    <h3>Immigration Anxiety</h3>
                    <p>The white-slave panic often portrayed "foreign men" as predators, reflecting broader anxieties about massive immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe and Asia.</p>
                    <p><strong>Common stereotypes</strong>: Italian, Jewish, Chinese, and other immigrant men were portrayed as sexually dangerous to white American women.</p>
                    <p><strong>What this reveals</strong>: The panic was partly about controlling immigrant communities and justifying restrictions on immigration.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="class-popup" class="popup">
                    <span class="popup-close" onclick="togglePopup('class-popup')">&times;</span>
                    <h3>Class Mobility and Anxiety</h3>
                    <p>Young working-class women were moving to cities, working for wages, and living independently—often in boarding houses without family supervision.</p>
                    <p><strong>Middle-class fear</strong>: These women might mix with "dangerous" men across class and ethnic lines.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result</strong>: Reformers focused on controlling working-class women's behavior while claiming to protect them.</p>
                </div>

                    <span class="popup-close" onclick="togglePopup('independence-popup')">&times;</span>
                    <h3>Female Independence</h3>
                    <p>The panic emerged exactly when women were gaining new freedoms: working for wages, living independently, socializing in public, delaying marriage.</p>
                    <p><strong>The contradiction</strong>: Reformers wanted women to be economically independent but sexually controlled. They celebrated women's work but feared women's autonomy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result</strong>: "Protection" often meant surveillance and restriction of women's freedom to move, work, and socialize.</p>

                    <h3>Racial Mixing</h3>
                    <p>The panic specifically focused on WHITE women, revealing its racial logic. The term "white slavery" deliberately invoked comparisons to Black slavery.</p>
                    <p><strong>The racial subtext</strong>: Fears about interracial relationships were central. Many reformers worried that urban anonymity would lead to relationships across racial boundaries.</p>
                    <p><strong>Who was ignored</strong>: Black, Asian, Latina, and Indigenous women facing sexual exploitation were largely excluded from reformers' concern.</p>
                </div>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This is the key analytical slide. The white-slave panic wasn't really about prostitution—it was about all these other anxieties displaced onto the figure of the endangered white woman.</p>
                    <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                    <p>Moral panics are always about more than they claim to be about. They condense multiple social anxieties into a simple, emotionally powerful story.</p>
                    <h4>Why this matters for understanding Progressive reform</h4>
                    <p>The same people who supported workplace regulation, consumer protection, and democratic reforms ALSO supported invasive policing of sexuality. This shows how Progressive reform could be both liberating and controlling.</p>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>Kevin Mumford</strong> in <em>Interzones</em> (1997) examines how Progressive-era reformers were obsessed with "vice districts" where racial mixing occurred. <strong>Estelle Freedman</strong> in <em>Redefining Rape</em> (2013) shows how concerns about sexual danger were deeply racialized throughout American history.</p>
                    <h4>Discussion Prompt</h4>
                    <p>Why do you think reformers focused so intensely on WHITE women? What does this reveal about whose vulnerability was considered important?</p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <div class="callout-title">Key Interpretive Point</div>
                    <p>The panic was less about prostitution itself than about <span class="key-term">who controlled women's bodies and movement</span></p>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This is the bottom line. The white-slave panic was fundamentally about power: Who gets to control women's sexuality, mobility, and economic choices?</p>
                    <h4>Questions this raises:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Who had authority over women's bodies: women themselves, families, government, employers?</li>
                        <li>Could women consent to sex work, or was all prostitution inherently coercive?</li>
                        <li>Who could women associate with, work for, live with, travel with?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why this is still relevant</h4>
                    <p>Contemporary debates about sex work, human trafficking, and consent echo these same tensions between protection and autonomy, between viewing women as victims or as agents.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">But this framing carried assumptions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Women were vulnerable rather than agentic</li>
                    <li>Sexual danger came from outside, not within social norms</li>
                    <li>Working-class women required supervision</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>Notice the problem: When you assume women are always vulnerable, you justify taking away their autonomy "for their own good."</p>
                    <h4>Key Definitions</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Protection</strong>: Keeping someone safe from harm</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h4>The Progressive assumption:</h4>
                    <p>Women, especially young working-class women, needed protection from predatory men and from their own poor judgment. This assumption justified extensive surveillance and restriction.</p>
                    <h4>What this ignored:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Women's economic need for independence</li>
                        <li>Women's ability to assess and manage risk</li>
                        <li>Dangers women faced within "respectable" society (domestic violence, workplace harassment by employers)</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>Linda Gordon</strong> and other historians have shown how Progressive-era reformers often saw themselves as experts who knew better than the people they were "helping."

                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This is crucial. When reformers couldn't tell the difference between a woman being forced and a woman choosing, they often assumed all working-class women in certain situations were victims who needed rescuing—whether they wanted rescue or not.</p>
                    <h4>Examples of blurred boundaries:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Coercion vs. consent</strong>: Women who chose sex work were treated as if they'd been coerced</li>
                        <li><strong>Protection vs. punishment</strong>: Women "rescued" from brothels were often institutionalized in reformatories</li>
                        <li><strong>Rescue vs. control</strong>: "Saving" women often meant restricting their freedom to work, travel, or associate with certain people</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Who bore the costs:</h4>
                    <p>Women themselves. They lost jobs, were separated from communities, were institutionalized against their will, and faced criminal prosecution—all in the name of "protection."</p>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>Barbara Meil Hobson</strong> and <strong>Ruth Rosen</strong> have both documented how Progressive-era anti-prostitution campaigns often punished the women they claimed to help while leaving male clients alone.</p>

                    <h3>"Immoral Purposes" - Deliberately Vague</h3>
                    <p>The Mann Act never defined what "immoral purposes" meant. This was intentional.</p>
                    <p><strong>What it could include</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prostitution (the stated purpose)</li>
                        <li>Adultery</li>
                        <li>Premarital sex</li>
                        <li>Interracial relationships</li>
                        <li>Any relationship authorities deemed "immoral"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why vagueness was powerful</strong>: It allowed prosecutors to target anyone they wanted, and let juries apply their own moral standards. This made the law a tool for enforcing prevailing social norms rather than preventing actual trafficking.</p>

                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>The Mann Act (also called the White Slave Traffic Act) was passed by Congress in 1910 at the height of the white-slave panic.</p>
                    <h4>Key Definitions</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mann Act</strong>: Federal law prohibiting transportation of women across state lines for "immoral purposes"</li>
                        <li><strong>Ambiguity</strong>: When language is unclear or can be interpreted multiple ways</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why this was a major expansion of federal power:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Before: Sexual morality was regulated locally by states and communities</li>
                        <li>After: The federal government claimed authority over intimate relationships</li>
                        <li>The Constitution doesn't give Congress power over morality—but it does give power over interstate commerce</li>
                        <li>By framing sexual morality as interstate transportation, Congress expanded its reach into private life</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>David Langum</strong> in <em>Crossing Over the Line</em> (1994) provides the definitive history of the Mann Act and shows how it was used far beyond its stated purpose of fighting trafficking.</p>

                <p>The undefined "immoral purposes" allowed:</p>

                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This was a massive shift in American governance. The federal government now claimed the right to regulate private sexual behavior.</p>
                    <h4>What this meant in practice:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Federal jurisdiction</strong>: FBI agents investigating people's sex lives</li>
                        <li><strong>No evidence of force needed</strong>: Consensual relationships could be prosecuted</li>
                        <li><strong>Policing of consensual relationships</strong>: If a man took a woman across state lines for any "immoral" reason—even just to have consensual sex—he could be prosecuted</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Examples of prosecution:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A man taking his girlfriend on vacation</li>
                        <li>Interracial couples traveling together</li>
                        <li>Unmarried couples eloping</li>
                        <li>People in extramarital affairs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The major shift:</h4>
                    <p>Before: Communities set moral standards locally. After: The federal government could enforce a national moral code. This was a huge expansion of federal power into areas previously considered private.</p>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>William Novak</strong> argues that American governments have always regulated morality, but the <em>scale</em> and <em>methods</em> changed dramatically in the Progressive Era with new bureaucratic and surveillance capacities.</p>

            <!-- Enforcement Patterns -->
            <section>
                <h2>Enforcement and Racial Power</h2>
                <p>Although justified as anti-trafficking legislation, enforcement patterns reveal deeper priorities</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">The Mann Act was disproportionately used against:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="popup-trigger" onclick="togglePopup('interracial-popup')">Interracial couples</span></li>
                    <li>Black men with white partners</li>

                    <li>Public figures who violated sexual norms</li>

                    <h3>Mann Act and Interracial Relationships</h3>
                    <p>One of the most common uses of the Mann Act was to prosecute interracial relationships, especially Black men with white partners.</p>
                    <p><strong>Famous cases:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Jack Johnson (1913)</strong>: The first Black heavyweight boxing champion was prosecuted under the Mann Act for traveling with his white girlfriend (who he later married)</li>
                        <li>Many other Black men were prosecuted for consensual relationships with white women</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why this matters</strong>: The law was supposedly about preventing forced prostitution, but it was actually used as a tool for enforcing racial segregation and punishing interracial intimacy.</p>
                    <p><strong>The racial logic</strong>: White women in relationships with Black men were assumed to be victims who needed "saving," even when the relationships were consensual and loving.</p>
                </div>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This is where we see the true purpose of the Mann Act. Look at who was actually prosecuted—it reveals what authorities really cared about.</p>
                    <h4>Key Pattern</h4>
                    <p>The law was supposedly about preventing trafficking, but enforcement focused on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Policing racial boundaries</li>
                        <li>Controlling working-class sexuality</li>
                        <li>Enforcing conventional morality</li>
                        <li>Punishing famous people who violated norms</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Who was NOT prosecuted:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wealthy white men with mistresses (as long as they were white)</li>
                        <li>Actual traffickers with power and connections</li>
                        <li>Men who stayed within racial and class boundaries</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The Jack Johnson Case (1913)</h4>
                    <p>Jack Johnson, the first Black heavyweight boxing champion, was a target of white supremacist rage because he defeated white boxers and dated white women. The government couldn't beat him in the ring, so they used the Mann Act to imprison him. He was convicted in 1913 for traveling with his white girlfriend (who he later married). He fled the country and lived in exile until 1920.</p>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>Kevin Mumford</strong> and <strong>David Langum</strong> have both documented how the Mann Act was primarily used to police racial and sexual boundaries rather than to prevent trafficking.</p>
                    <h4>Discussion Prompt</h4>
                    <p>What does enforcement tell us about a law's real purpose? How can laws with one stated purpose be used for completely different purposes?</p>

                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This is the key takeaway about the Mann Act: It was a tool of social control disguised as protection.</p>
                    <h4>The pattern:</h4>
                    <p>Throughout the Progressive Era, state power expanded most dramatically in areas where authorities were most anxious:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sexuality and gender roles</li>
                        <li>Racial boundaries</li>
                        <li>Immigration and "Americanization"</li>
                        <li>Working-class behavior</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why this pattern matters:</h4>
                    <p>It shows that Progressive reform wasn't just about making society better. It was also about controlling people who threatened existing power structures—women demanding independence, people of color challenging segregation, immigrants maintaining their cultures, workers organizing for power.</p>
                    <h4>The contradiction:</h4>
                    <p>The same movement that expanded democracy also expanded surveillance and coercion. This is the central tension of Progressivism.</p>

                    <p><strong>Vice commissions</strong>: Investigative bodies that studied prostitution, documented "vice districts," and recommended policies. They gathered detailed information about people's private lives.</p>
                    <p><strong>Undercover policing</strong>: Police posed as customers or workers to gather evidence. This was a new form of surveillance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Moral courts</strong>: Special courts to handle prostitution and "sexual immorality" cases, often with lower standards of evidence.</p>
                    <p><strong>Social workers as investigators</strong>: Social workers gathered detailed case files on families, including intimate information about sexual behavior.</p>
                    <p><strong>Recordkeeping</strong>: For the first time, government agencies kept detailed records of people's sexual behavior, creating files that could be used against them.</p>

                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This slide is about the methods, not just the laws. The Progressive Era created entirely new ways for government to observe, record, and regulate private behavior.</p>
                    <h4>Key Definitions</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Surveillance</strong>: Systematic observation and monitoring of people's behavior</li>
                        <li><strong>Vice commission</strong>: Official body investigating moral behavior, especially prostitution</li>
                        <li><strong>Bureaucratic oversight</strong>: Government regulation through agencies, paperwork, and professional expertise rather than personal authority</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What was new:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Systematic investigation</strong>: Not just punishing crime after it happened, but actively investigating private behavior</li>
                        <li><strong>Professional expertise</strong>: Social workers, doctors, and "experts" claimed authority over morality</li>
                        <li><strong>Record-keeping</strong>: Creating permanent files on people's intimate lives</li>
                        <li><strong>Centralization</strong>: Moving from local, informal moral regulation to centralized, bureaucratic control</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>Michel Foucault</strong> argues that modern power operates through surveillance and knowledge-gathering rather than just punishment. The Progressive Era is when American government developed these techniques on a large scale.</p>
                    <h4>Why this matters:</h4>
                    <p>These techniques became permanent features of the modern state. Once established, they could be used for many purposes beyond the original moral reform agenda.</p>

                        <li><strong>Observable</strong>: Government actively investigated and monitored sexual behavior</li>
                        <li><strong>Categorizable</strong>: People were sorted into categories (normal/deviant, moral/immoral, fit/unfit)</li>
                        <li><strong>Punishable</strong>: The state claimed authority to punish private behavior</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Bridge to next lecture:</h4>
                    <p>Once sexuality became an object of expert knowledge and bureaucratic management, the next step was to treat it as a scientific problem that could be studied and solved. That's where Lecture 3 picks up.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Limits and Consequences</h2>
                <p>Despite expansive policing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prostitution did not disappear</li>
                    <li>Exploitation persisted</li>
                    <li>Women bore the greatest costs of enforcement</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 1em; font-style: italic; color: var(--pale-sunlight);">Interpretive question: What happens when reform defines danger so broadly that normal human behavior becomes suspect?</p>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This is the evaluation section. Did all this surveillance and prosecution actually accomplish its stated goals?</p>
                    <h4>The outcomes:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Prostitution continued</strong>: It went underground, became less visible, and possibly more dangerous</li>
                        <li><strong>Exploitation persisted</strong>: The economic conditions that drove women to sex work didn't change</li>
                        <li><strong>Women bore the costs</strong>: Women were arrested, institutionalized, and stigmatized while male clients were rarely punished</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Unintended consequences:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sex workers lost whatever protection they had from operating openly</li>
                        <li>Women were driven into more dangerous situations</li>
                        <li>Police corruption increased (vice enforcement was notoriously corrupt)</li>
                        <li>Racial and class inequalities were reinforced</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The interpretive question:</h4>
                    <p>"What happens when reform defines danger so broadly that normal human behavior becomes suspect?" This question applies beyond sexuality:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When does public health policy become invasive surveillance?</li>
                        <li>When does crime prevention become harassment?</li>
                        <li>When does protecting children become denying autonomy?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                    <p><strong>Ruth Rosen</strong> argues that Progressive anti-prostitution campaigns failed to address the economic inequality that drove most women to sex work. Without alternative economic opportunities, policing just made things worse.</p>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
                    <p>This is the summary of our entire argument. Progressive reform had a dark side.</p>
                    <h4>The three key points:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fear, not evidence</strong>: The white-slave panic was based on exaggeration and sensationalism, but it produced real laws and real punishment</li>
                        <li><strong>Protection justified punishment</strong>: The language was always about protecting vulnerable women, but the outcome was punishment and control</li>
                        <li><strong>Expanded state authority</strong>: The federal government gained power to regulate the most intimate aspects of life</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What "technology of governance" means:</h4>
                    <p>Moral panic wasn't just an emotion—it was a <em>tool</em> that authorities used to justify expanding their power. By creating fear, they created support for surveillance, policing, and control.</p>
                    <h4>Why this matters for understanding Progressivism:</h4>
                    <p>The Progressive Era expanded both democracy AND coercion. It protected consumers AND invaded privacy. It empowered experts AND disempowered ordinary people. These contradictions are at the heart of Progressive reform.</p>
                    <h4>Looking forward:</h4>
                    <p>Lecture 3 will show how sexuality became not just a target of policing but an object of scientific study and expertise. Lecture 4 will show how this logic extended to eugenics and permanent coercion.</p>
