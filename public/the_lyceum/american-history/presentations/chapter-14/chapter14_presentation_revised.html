                        <h3>Stephen A. Douglas (1813-1861)</h3>
                        <p>Democratic Senator from Illinois, known as "The Little Giant" for his small stature and powerful oratory. Douglas championed popular sovereignty as a compromise solution to the slavery question, believing local voters should decide. His Kansas-Nebraska Act destroyed his presidential ambitions by alienating both Northern and Southern factions.</p>

                        <h4>📚 What You Need to Know</h4>
                        <p>Douglas's Kansas-Nebraska Act fundamentally altered the political landscape. By allowing popular sovereignty, it opened territory previously closed to slavery, enraging Northern voters who saw it as a betrayal of the sacred Missouri Compromise.</p>

                            <li><strong>Popular Sovereignty</strong>: The idea that settlers in a territory should decide for themselves whether to allow slavery</li>
                            <li><strong>Missouri Compromise</strong>: 1820 agreement that prohibited slavery north of 36°30' latitude (except Missouri)</li>

                        <h4>💭 Context & Connections</h4>
                        <p>Douglas was motivated primarily by economic development - he wanted Chicago to be the eastern terminus of the transcontinental railroad. But to get Southern support, he had to offer something on slavery. This connects to Manifest Destiny and the Market Revolution.</p>

                        <p>The Missouri Compromise had successfully maintained an uneasy balance between free and slave states. Its repeal shattered that balance and convinced many Northerners that a "Slave Power" conspiracy was working to extend slavery everywhere.</p>
                        
                        <h4>💭 Context & Connections</h4>
                        <p>Many Northerners had come to view the Missouri Compromise line as permanent and inviolable - almost constitutional. Its destruction made them feel the rules of the political game had been changed without their consent.</p>

                        <p>The Whig Party's collapse represented the failure of national political institutions to contain sectional tensions. The party that had elected two presidents (Harrison and Taylor) could not survive the slavery controversy.</p>
                        
                        <h4>🎓 Senior Historians' Corner</h4>
                        <p><strong>Michael Holt</strong> argues the Whig collapse was about more than slavery - it was also about the party's failure to address economic issues after the Mexican War. The vacuum left by Whig collapse allowed both Know-Nothings and Republicans to compete for former Whig voters.</p>

                        <h3>Free Labor Ideology</h3>
                        <p>The central belief that every person should own their own labor and have the opportunity to improve their condition through hard work. Republicans argued that slavery degraded all labor and threatened Northern workers' opportunities. This ideology united farmers, workers, and businessmen against slavery's expansion - not necessarily because they cared about enslaved people, but because they feared slavery's competition.</p>

                        <p>The Republican Party's emergence as a sectional party marked a dangerous development. For the first time, a major party had no presence in half the country, making sectional conflict almost inevitable.</p>
                        
                        <h4>💭 Context & Connections</h4>
                        <p>The Republican coalition was fragile - it included abolitionists who wanted to end slavery everywhere, moderates who just wanted to stop its spread, and former Know-Nothings who cared more about immigration. What united them was opposition to the "Slave Power."</p>

                        <p><strong>Eric Foner</strong> emphasizes free labor ideology as the glue holding diverse Republicans together. It allowed them to oppose slavery without advocating racial equality.</p>

                        <p>This massive wave of immigration transformed American cities and created a new urban working class. The scale was unprecedented - nearly 15% of the U.S. population by 1860 was foreign-born.</p>

                        <h3>Revolutions of 1848</h3>
                        <p>A wave of liberal and nationalist revolutions swept across Europe in 1848, seeking constitutional government and national unity. Most failed, leading to a diaspora of political refugees called "Forty-Eighters." These were often educated, politically radical, and committed to republican ideals - they would become important Republicans and abolitionists in America.</p>

                        <h3>John C. Frémont (1813-1890)</h3>
                        <p>"The Pathfinder" was a famous Western explorer and military officer. Republicans chose him for his celebrity and lack of political baggage. Though he lost in 1856, his strong showing in the North proved that a purely sectional party could compete for the presidency. In 1860, Republicans would nominate a more experienced politician: Abraham Lincoln.</p>

                        <p>The election of 1856 showed that American politics had become thoroughly sectionalized. The Republican Party's strong showing proved it was now a major force, setting the stage for Lincoln's victory in 1860.</p>
                        
                        <h4>💭 Context & Connections</h4>
                        <p>The math was clear: if Republicans could win just Pennsylvania and one other Northern state they'd lost, they could win the presidency without a single Southern vote. This terrified Southerners and emboldened Republicans.</p>

                        <h3>Dred Scott (c. 1799-1858)</h3>
                        <p>Born into slavery in Virginia, Scott was taken by his owner to the free state of Illinois and then Wisconsin Territory, where slavery was prohibited by the Missouri Compromise. After returning to Missouri (a slave state), Scott sued for his freedom, arguing that residence in free territory made him free. His case became the most important Supreme Court decision before the Civil War.</p>

                        <p>Taney's decision was a disaster for the Court and the country. By declaring that Congress could never prohibit slavery in territories, he destroyed the basis for compromise and outraged the North.

                        <p><strong>Don Fehrenbacher</strong> argues the decision was legally unsound even by 1857 standards. Taney went far beyond what the case required, making sweeping pronouncements designed to settle the slavery question forever. Instead, he made it worse.</p>

                        <p>A non-slaveholding white North Carolinian who wrote <em>The Impending Crisis of the South</em> (1857). Helper attacked slavery not on moral grounds but as economically harmful to poor whites. His argument that slavery kept the South backward and poor whites oppressed was explosive - it suggested class conflict might split the white South. Helper was not an abolitionist and was deeply racist, but his book became Republican propaganda.</p>

                        <p>Born in Kentucky, raised in Indiana and Illinois. Self-educated lawyer and former Whig congressman. Lincoln opposed slavery as morally wrong but was not an abolitionist - he did not advocate immediate emancipation or racial equality. His position was that slavery should be contained, not abolished where it existed. The debates would make him famous and lead to his 1860 nomination.</p>

                        <p>Brown learned abolitionism from his father and never wavered from it. His friendship with a black boy during the War of 1812 convinced him that blacks were not inferior. Unlike most abolitionists, Brown was willing to use violence.</p>

They knew Brown planned violence but most did not know the specific target. Several fled to Canada when the raid failed, fearing prosecution. Their involvement showed respectable abolitionists were willing to fund armed insurrection.</p>

                        <p>U.S. Army colonel in 1859, Lee happened to be on leave in Washington when Brown's raid occurred. He was sent to command the Marines who captured Brown. Less than two years later, Lee would resign from the U.S. Army to command Confederate forces against the Union. His role at Harpers Ferry was a small irony of history.</p>

                        <p>Before Harpers Ferry, abolitionism was not quite respectable even in the North. By taking armed action, Brown made verbal antislavery seem moderate.
