                    <h4>🎯 Teaching Note</h4>
                    <p>This standalone presentation explores Jacob Riis's pioneering use of documentary photography to expose urban poverty in New York City's tenement districts. Riis represents the bridge between 19th-century charitable reform and 20th-century Progressive Era structural reform—using visual evidence to shift the conversation from individual moral failure to systemic problems requiring government intervention.</p>
                    <p>The presentation traces Riis's background, his revolutionary use of flash powder photography, the strategic deployment of magic lantern lectures, and the legislative outcomes his work helped achieve. This sets the foundation for understanding Lewis Hine's later child labor photography.</p>

                    <p>By the late 1880s, New York's Lower East Side had become the most densely populated place on Earth:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-top: 1em; font-size: 1.1em;">
                        <li><strong style="color: var(--gold-accent);">290,000 people per square mile</strong> in the Tenth Ward</li>

                        <li>Thousands sleeping in hallways, basements, on roofs</li>
                        <li>No parks, playgrounds, or public spaces</li>

                    <h4>📖 Context</h4>
                    <p>The scale of New York's tenement crisis in the 1880s is almost incomprehensible by modern standards. The Lower East Side's density exceeded anything in contemporary London, Paris, or Berlin. The Tenth Ward packed 290,000 people per square mile—nearly triple the density of today's Manhattan.</p>
                    <p>This wasn't just poverty—it was architectural failure combined with unregulated capitalism. Tenement buildings maximized profit by cramming as many families as possible into minimal space. "Dumbbell" tenements (named for their shape when viewed from above) had rooms in the center with no windows, receiving light only from tiny airshafts that filled with garbage and provided no meaningful ventilation.</p>
                    <p>The immigrant surge of the 1880s intensified the crisis. Southern and Eastern Europeans—Italians, Jews, Poles—arrived in waves, settling into neighborhoods where housing stock couldn't accommodate the numbers. Landlords subdivided already-cramped apartments. Families took in boarders to afford rent. Children slept in shifts.</p>
                    <p>This context is crucial: when Riis started photographing, the problem wasn't hidden because it was small—it was hidden because middle-class New Yorkers never entered these neighborhoods and couldn't imagine conditions this extreme.</p>

                            <li><strong>Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (1874)</strong> — rescued abused children</li>
                            <li><strong>Children's Aid Society</strong> — placed orphans with families</li>
                            <li><strong>Settlement houses</strong> — provided services in poor neighborhoods</li>

                    <h4>📖 Understanding the Shift</h4>
                    <p>This slide establishes the crucial distinction between 19th-century charity and Progressive Era reform. The 1874 Mary Ellen Wilson case had led to creation of the SPCC—the first organization with legal authority to remove children from abusive homes. This was genuine progress. An individual child being beaten could now be rescued by the state.</p>
                    <p>But ten years later, the structural conditions remained unchanged. The SPCC could remove a child from an abusive parent—but what if the "abuse" was actually the result of a family of ten living in two airless rooms? What if parents weren't neglectful but simply unable to supervise children in neighborhoods with no safe spaces to play? What if children worked in sweatshops not because parents were greedy but because family survival required every possible income?</p>
                    <p>The charitable model assumed poverty resulted from individual moral failure—bad parents, weak character, lack of discipline. The structural model (which Riis pioneered) assumed poverty resulted from systemic failures—bad housing, exploitative labor markets, inadequate public investment, corrupt political machines that prioritized developer profits over human welfare.</p>
                    <p>This reframing is the foundation of Progressive reform. Riis didn't invent it—settlement house workers and labor organizers were already thinking systemically—but his photographs made the argument visually undeniable.</p>

                    <h4>📖 Riis's Formative Experience</h4>
                    <p>Jacob Riis's personal history is crucial for understanding his work. Unlike most Gilded Age reformers, he had experienced homelessness and destitution firsthand. When he arrived in America in 1870, he spent years taking whatever work he could find—carpenter, farmhand, brickmaker. He slept in police station lodging houses where homeless men were allowed to spend nights. He knew what hunger felt like, what it meant to be turned away from doors, what it cost psychologically to be treated as disposable.</p>
                    <p>This experience gave his later reform work an authenticity that middle-class reformers couldn't match. When he described tenement conditions, he wasn't speculating or theorizing—he was describing variations of spaces he'd personally inhabited. When he photographed men sleeping on grates or in police basements, he was documenting worlds he'd lived in.</p>
                    <p>His breakthrough came when he became a police reporter. The job required him to spend nights at police headquarters, which gave him access to tenement districts and police lodging houses. He saw the same conditions year after year—children on streets, families in overcrowded rooms, homeless men in basements—and realized that individual charity wasn't changing anything fundamental.</p>
                    <p>The decision to use photography came from frustration with the limits of written journalism. He'd been writing articles about tenement conditions for years. Readers might be momentarily moved, but they couldn't truly visualize what he described. Flash powder photography, newly available in the mid-1880s, gave him the tool he needed.</p>

                        For the first time, <strong>interior rooms without windows</strong> could be photographed.

                        had literally never been seen by the public. Reform began when darkness became evidence.

                    <h4>📖 Technology as Reform Tool</h4>
                    <p>Flash powder photography was crude, dangerous, and absolutely essential to Riis's work. The technology had only become available in the mid-1880s, which is part of why Riis's documentation was possible when it was. Cameras existed decades earlier, but they required long exposures in well-lit spaces. Interior photography of dark tenement rooms was impossible without artificial light.</p>
                    <p>The process was dramatic: Riis and his assistants would enter tenements late at night, often accompanied by police officers. They'd set up the camera, open the shutter, and an assistant would touch a match to a pan of flash powder—BOOM—a brilliant explosive flash followed by thick, acrid smoke that filled the room. Residents, many of whom had never seen a camera, were terrified. Some thought it was a bomb. Others thought police were raiding.</p>
                    <p>Riis set at least two documented fires in tenement buildings when flash powder ignited nearby materials. He blew out windows. In police lodging houses, sleeping homeless men scattered in panic. Despite the risks, Riis persisted because he understood that the worst conditions—the airless interior rooms, the basement workshops, the spaces where people actually lived—were invisible without this technology.</p>
                    <p>The physical danger of flash powder mirrored the social danger of exposure. Society didn't want to see these conditions any more than tenement residents wanted midnight explosions in their rooms. Making the invisible visible required tools that disrupted comfort—both for subjects and for audiences.</p>

                <aside class="notes">
                    <h4>📖 Multimedia Advocacy Before Mass Media</h4>
                    <p>Riis pioneered what we'd now call multimedia advocacy. He didn't simply publish photographs and hope people noticed—he performed strategic presentations combining images, narrative, and emotional appeal. Magic lantern shows (the PowerPoint of the 1890s) allowed him to control the experience: darkened room, projected images, his voice providing context and interpretation.</p>
                    <p>His target audience was crucial. He wasn't trying to convince tenement residents that conditions were bad—they knew. He was trying to convince middle-class and wealthy New Yorkers who had political influence but had never personally witnessed tenement life. These were people who could pressure city government, donate to reform causes, vote for building codes and park legislation.</p>
                    <p>The combination of image and narrative was powerful. A photograph showed a family of ten in a tiny room. Riis would provide names: "This is the Costello family—Mrs. Costello, her six children, her sister, and two boarders. They live in two rooms on Mulberry Street. The children sleep in shifts because there aren't enough beds." The specificity made abstraction impossible. These weren't "the poor"—they were the Costellos, with names and addresses and stories.</p>
                    <p>Riis often timed his lectures to coincide with specific reform campaigns. When activists were pushing for tenement regulation, he'd give lectures showing the conditions regulations would address. When park advocates wanted funding, he'd show photographs of children playing in garbage-filled alleys because no other spaces existed. The photographs weren't just documentation—they were ammunition in political fights.</p>

                    <h4>📖 Experiencing Riis's Method</h4>
                    <p>This video recreates what Riis's audiences experienced in the 1890s. Watch for the combination of visual shock and narrative context. Notice how he doesn't just show images—he tells stories, provides names and ages, describes smells and sounds and temperatures. The power came from pairing photographic evidence with human details that made viewers see tenement residents as real people rather than abstract statistics.</p>
                    <p>Also pay attention to the audience Riis targeted. These were middle-class and upper-class Americans who had never set foot in a tenement. His strategy was to transport them visually into spaces they would never otherwise enter and force them to confront what their comfortable lives depended on ignoring.</p>
                    <p>This is the same method Lewis Hine would later use for child labor photography—strategic deployment of visual evidence to generate political pressure. Riis pioneered the template.</p>

                    <h4>📖 The Intellectual Revolution</h4>
                    <p>This reframing is one of the most important intellectual shifts in American reform history. Read the comparison carefully. "Which parents are neglecting their children?" assumes the problem is individual—bad parents who need to be identified and punished or reformed. "How can any parent raise children in these conditions?" assumes the problem is structural—systems that make good parenting impossible regardless of individual character.</p>
                    <p>Riis's opening line in <em>How the Other Half Lives</em> is revealing: "one half of the world does not know how the other half lives... It did not know because it did not care." This isn't just about ignorance—it's about willful blindness. Middle-class New Yorkers could have learned about tenement conditions if they'd wanted to. They didn't want to because knowledge would require action, and action would cost money and political capital.</p>
                    <p>The shift from individual to structural analysis is the foundation of Progressive reform. Once you see poverty as systemic rather than personal, the solutions change: instead of charity and moral reform, you need building codes, labor regulation, public parks, compulsory education, sanitation systems. This requires government intervention, which requires political will, which requires public pressure—which is why Riis's photographs mattered so much.</p>

                    <h4>📖 From Exposure to Legislation</h4>
                    <p>Riis's work contributed directly to concrete legislative reforms. The Tenement House Act of 1901 was the most comprehensive housing regulation in American history to that point, mandating windows in every room, indoor plumbing, fire escapes, and sanitation standards. Riis's photographs had made the case for these requirements by showing exactly what happened without them.</p>
                    <p>His campaign for parks in tenement districts succeeded in creating several small parks where children could play safely—previously, streets and garbage-filled alleys were the only options. City officials credited Riis personally with making these parks happen through his lectures and lobbying.</p>
                    <p>The alliance with Theodore Roosevelt was crucial. Roosevelt read <em>How the Other Half Lives</em> in 1890 and immediately went to Riis's office to volunteer his help. As Police Commissioner (1895-1897), Roosevelt closed the worst police lodging houses that Riis had documented, improved conditions in those that remained, and used his political influence to support tenement reform. Their friendship lasted until Riis's death in 1914.</p>
                    <p>Settlement houses like Hull House in Chicago adopted Riis's method of systematic documentation combined with strategic public advocacy. The entire Progressive reform template—investigate, document, expose, demand structural change—traces directly to what Riis pioneered in the late 1880s.</p>

                    <h4>📖 Documentary Authenticity: The Nuanced View</h4>
                    <p>This slide addresses one of the most important questions about documentary photography: if images were staged, can they still be considered valid evidence? The sophisticated answer focuses on what truth the photographer was trying to tell.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Historical Precedent: Gardner at Gettysburg</h4>
                    <p>To understand Riis's staging in context, it helps to know this was already an established practice in documentary photography. Alexander Gardner's famous Gettysburg photograph "Home of a Rebel Sharpshooter" shows a dead Confederate soldier positioned among rocks, rifle at his side. Scholars have proven Gardner moved the body from another location and positioned the rifle for dramatic effect.</p>
                    <p><strong>This wasn't fraud in Gardner's mind—it was standard practice.</strong> Photography was a business for Gardner. He needed images that sold. The staging created a narrative: the young rebel who died at his post, alone among the rocks. That narrative moved viewers and moved product.</p>
                    <p><strong>The question isn't "Did he lie?"</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>The question is: What truth was he trying to tell?</strong></p>
                    <p>Gardner wanted viewers to feel the war's tragedy—the young man who would never go home. The staging served that emotional truth even as it fabricated specific details.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Riis: A Different Motivation</h4>
                    <p>Riis operated from different motivations than Gardner. This wasn't primarily a business for him—it was reform advocacy. He used staging not to sell images but to tell the truth about children's experiences in tenements.</p>
                    <p>When Riis arranged subjects in "Lodgers in a Crowded Bayard Street Tenement," he wasn't fabricating conditions. Families genuinely lived that way—ten people in spaces the size of closets, sleeping in shifts because there weren't enough beds. The staging didn't create false conditions; it made real conditions visible and emotionally accessible to middle-class viewers who had never witnessed such suffering.</p>
                    <p>The technical constraints of 1880s photography (slow cameras, dangerous flash powder, long exposures) made staging necessary. But more importantly, Riis understood that reform required not just information but emotional impact. Middle-class audiences needed to *feel* what tenement life meant for children—the claustrophobia, the lack of privacy, the impossibility of normal childhood in such spaces.</p>
                    
                    <h4>The Truth Question</h4>
                    <p><strong>The photographs didn't lie.</strong> They told the truth about systemic conditions—about how children actually lived in New York's tenement districts. The specific positioning of subjects was constructed, but the conditions depicted were brutally real.</p>
                    <p>This is the crucial distinction: Riis dramatized real conditions; he didn't fabricate false ones. There's a difference between arranging people in a genuinely overcrowded room to show that overcrowding more effectively, versus staging a scene of overcrowding in a room that wasn't actually crowded. Riis did the former.</p>
                    <p>His staging served the truth of children's experience. That's what matters for understanding his work as documentary evidence. The camera doesn't simply record reality—it constructs arguments about reality. Riis constructed arguments about tenement conditions that were simultaneously carefully crafted AND genuinely truthful about how people lived.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Why This Matters for Students</h4>
                    <p>Understanding staging helps students think sophisticatedly about documentary evidence. It's not a binary between "objective truth" and "lies." Documentary work always involves choices—what to photograph, how to frame it, how to present it. Riis made those choices strategically to generate political pressure for reform.</p>
                    <p>His photographs were powerful evidence that contributed to real legislative victories—the Tenement House Act of 1901, parks in tenement districts, momentum for child labor reform. They were also carefully constructed to maximize emotional impact. Both things are true. The construction doesn't invalidate the evidence—it reveals how documentary advocacy actually works.</p>
                    <p>This same pattern appears throughout reform photography: Lewis Hine's child labor images, Dorothea Lange's Depression photographs, contemporary photojournalism documenting poverty or human rights abuses. All involve staging or arrangement to some degree. The question isn't whether they staged it, but whether the staging accurately represents real conditions that needed exposure.</p>
                    <p>Students should come away understanding: Riis's staging doesn't make him dishonest—it makes him an effective advocate who understood that visibility alone isn't enough. Conditions need to be made visible in ways that move audiences to action.</p>

                    <h4>📖 The Template for Progressive Reform</h4>
                    <p>Riis created the blueprint that Progressive reformers would follow for the next three decades. The method was systematic: find hidden problems, document them rigorously, present evidence strategically to audiences with political power, and demand government intervention rather than relying on charity.</p>
                    <p>Lewis Hine's child labor photography (which you'll study in HIST 102) built directly on Riis's foundation. When the National Child Labor Committee hired Hine in 1908, they explicitly told him to do for child labor what Riis had done for tenement conditions. Hine traveled the country photographing children in mills, mines, and canneries, using the same combination of visual evidence and strategic advocacy that Riis pioneered.</p>
                    <p>Settlement houses adopted Riis's documentation methods. Hull House in Chicago produced reports with photographs showing neighborhood conditions. The Henry Street Settlement in New York did the same. These weren't just charitable organizations—they were research institutions producing evidence for political campaigns.</p>
                    <p>The broader documentary tradition in American photography traces back to Riis. Dorothea Lange's Depression-era photographs of migrant workers, Gordon Parks's civil rights photography, contemporary photojournalists documenting human rights abuses—all stand in a lineage that begins with Riis exploding flash powder in tenement rooms in 1887.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Riis proved that photography could be a tool for structural reform—not just documentation, but evidence deployed strategically to generate political pressure.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">His work helped shift American reform from individual charity to systemic intervention. The question changed from "which people are failing?" to "which systems are failing people?"</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">But visibility alone wasn't enough—it required sustained organizing, political alliances, and legislative campaigns. And even successful reforms carried the limitations of their advocates' vision.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1.5em;"><strong style="color: var(--gold-accent);">The fundamental question remains: Who is doing this work today? Who is making invisible problems visible in our time?</strong></p>

                    <h4>🎯 Teaching Note</h4>
                    <p>This conclusion returns to core themes: the power of visual evidence, the shift from individual to structural reform, and the complexity of historical actors who achieve real change while carrying real prejudices.</p>
                    <p>Riis's work demonstrates that exposure can shift culture and create political will for reform. His photographs made tenement conditions impossible to ignore and contributed directly to legislative victories. That's genuine achievement.</p>
                    <p>But the conclusion also emphasizes that visibility alone isn't sufficient. Riis's photographs mattered because they were part of larger campaigns involving settlement houses, labor organizers, political reformers, and sympathetic officials like Theodore Roosevelt. Documentary evidence is powerful, but it requires organization and sustained pressure to translate into policy.</p>
                    <p>The final question—"Who is doing this work today?"—is designed to make students think about contemporary applications. Who uses visual media now to expose hidden conditions? Documentary filmmakers? Investigative journalists? Social media activists? What are the modern equivalents of flash powder—the technologies that make invisible problems visible?</p>
                    <p>This presentation sets up the Lewis Hine material perfectly. Students now understand the documentary tradition's origins, its Progressive Era template, and its combination of achievement and limitation. When they encounter Hine's child labor photography, they'll see the direct continuation of Riis's method—and they'll be prepared to ask similar questions about power, visibility, and the relationship between evidence and reform.</p>
