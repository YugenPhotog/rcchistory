## 📚 Speaker Notes — What You Need to Know

This presentation examines one of the most consequential federal policies in U.S. history: the forced displacement of tens of thousands of Indigenous people from the southeastern United States to lands west of the Mississippi River during the 1830s. This was not a spontaneous event but a coordinated program involving federal law, state coercion, and military enforcement.

### 📖 Context & Scope
While the “Trail of Tears” commonly refers to the Cherokee removal of 1838–1839, this presentation covers the broader removal policy affecting multiple nations: Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek (Muscogee), Chickasaw, and Seminole.

### 💭 Why This Matters
Indian removal demonstrates how state power can use law to legitimize dispossession, how political coalitions form around territorial expansion, and how administrative choices determine life-or-death outcomes.

## What Was Indian Removal?

- Federal program to relocate Indigenous nations from east of the Mississippi to “Indian Territory” (present-day Oklahoma)
- Operated through a combination of law, treaties, and coercion
- Decade-spanning policy (1830s)
- Resulted in mass displacement, deaths from disease and exposure, and territorial reorganization

## Antecedents: The Cotton Economy

### Post-War of 1812 Expansion
- Cotton production explodes with spread of short-staple cotton
- Entrenchment of enslaved labor system
- Land becomes the critical bottleneck

### Pressure on Native Lands
- Planters, speculators, small farmers push into Indigenous homelands
- Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee
- Native landholding treated as illegitimate

---

## The “Civilization” Paradox

- U.S. policy encouraged Native “civilization”
- Southeastern nations adopted written constitutions, schools, newspapers
- Assimilation intensified conflict instead of preventing removal

---

## Georgia and the Sovereignty Crisis

- Extension of state law over Cherokee territory
- Criminalization of Cherokee governance
- Seizure and redistribution of land
- Acceleration after the 1828 gold discovery
