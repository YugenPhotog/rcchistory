# Indian Removal Policy as Ethnic Cleansing
## 1820–1845

---

## Native Americans After the War of 1812

### The Situation
- ~125,000 Native peoples live east of the Mississippi River
- **Five “Civilized Tribes” in the Southeast: ~60,000 people**
  - Cherokee
  - Creek (Muscogee)
  - Choctaw
  - Chickasaw
  - Seminole
- Increasingly surrounded by white settlement

### Federal Policy Claims
- “Civilize” and “Christianize” Native peoples
- After assimilation, they may remain on their lands
- Assimilation presented as the official goal

---

## 📖 Lecture Notes — Understanding This Slide

**Main idea:** After 1815, Native peoples were not “vanishing,” but adapting, governing, and thriving in ways that directly conflicted with white expansion.

- Indigenous nations built governments, schools, newspapers, and economies
- Their success intensified pressure for removal rather than reducing it
- Assimilation threatened white claims to land and sovereignty

## Why Removal Happened: A Three-Part Engine

### 🔎 Popup — Economic Greed: Land Hunger
- Southeast contains the most fertile land in the United States
- Ideal for cotton cultivation as slavery expands
- **Gold discovered in Georgia (1828)**
- White settlers want this land immediately

### 🔎 Popup — Racial Ideology: “Civilization” Rhetoric as Cover
- **Official claim:** “Indians can’t civilize, so they must move.”
- **Reality:** Even when tribes adopted American culture, whites wanted them gone
- Racial hierarchy persisted regardless of behavior

### 🔎 Popup — Political Pressure
- **Georgia’s 1802 Compact:** Federal promise to extinguish Indian land title
- Georgia threatens to defy federal authority
- Federal government caves to state pressure

---

## 📚 Lecture Notes — Synthesis

**Removal is driven by a triad:**  
**Land hunger**, **racial ideology**, and **political pressure**—three gears turning the same shaft toward dispossession.

When **profit**, **prejudice**, and **politics** align, policy follows.

## Indian Removal as Ethnic Cleansing

### Key Characteristics
- Targeted removal of a population from a specific territory
- Legal justification masking coercion
- Destruction of social, cultural, and economic life
- Predictable mass mortality

Removal was not accidental. The human costs were known in advance.

---

## Legal Framework

- Indian Removal Act (1830)
- Treaty system under coercion
- State nullification of Native sovereignty
- Federal refusal to enforce Supreme Court rulings

---

## Worcester v. Georgia (1832)

- Supreme Court recognizes Cherokee sovereignty
- Declares Georgia laws unconstitutional
- Georgia ignores ruling
- Federal government refuses enforcement

**Legal victory without political power**

---

## Implementation on the Ground

- Roundups into detention camps
- Overcrowding and disease
- Winter marches over 1,000 miles
- Contracted transportation incentivized cost-cutting

---

## Human Consequences

### Death Toll Estimates
- Thousands died during removal
- **Cherokee: ~4,000 deaths (≈20% of population)**

### Causes of Death
- Disease (dysentery, measles, cholera)
- Exposure
- Malnutrition
- Exhaustion

Elders and children were the most vulnerable.

## 📚 Lecture Notes — Interpreting the Death Toll

Prucha, Satz, Perdue & Green, and Russell Thornton all offer compatible quantitative ranges.  
Discrepancies reflect archival gaps and differing methodologies—not uncertainty about mass death itself.

---

## Aftermath

- Spiritual sites abandoned
- Economic systems destroyed
- Political fragmentation
- Long-term trauma in Indian Territory

Removal reshaped Native life permanently.

---

## Why This Matters

Indian removal demonstrates how:
- Democratic institutions can enact ethnic cleansing
- Law can legitimize dispossession
- Bureaucratic decisions become lethal

This is not a story of inevitability—it is a story of choice.
