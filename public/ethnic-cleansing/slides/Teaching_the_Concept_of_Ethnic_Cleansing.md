# Understanding Ethnic Cleansing
## Concepts, Patterns, and Historical Examples

---

## What Is Ethnic Cleansing?

### Definition

**Ethnic cleansing** is the systematic forced removal or extermination of ethnic, racial, or religious groups from a specific territory.

The goal is to create an ethnically homogeneous region by expelling or eliminating the targeted group.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Systematic:** Not random violence but organized policy
- **State-sponsored:** Requires government authority and resources
- **Targeted:** Aims at specific ethnic, racial, or religious groups
- **Territorial:** Seeks to create homogeneous demographic zones

## Methods of Ethnic Cleansing

### How Is Ethnic Cleansing Carried Out?

#### Forced Displacement
- Mass deportations
- Forced marches
- Removal to designated zones
- Denial of return rights

#### Violence and Terror
- Massacres and executions
- Rape as weapon of war
- Torture and intimidation
- Destruction of cultural sites

### Systematic Destruction
- Property confiscation
- Destruction of homes, farms, and infrastructure
- Erasure of cultural and religious landmarks

## Ethnic Cleansing vs. Genocide

### What's the Difference?

| Aspect | Ethnic Cleansing | Genocide |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| **Primary Goal** | Remove group from territory | Destroy group entirely |
| **Intent** | Forced displacement | Annihilation |
| **Methods** | Deportation, terror, violence | Mass killing, extermination |
| **Legal Status** | Crime against humanity | Specific international crime (1948 Convention) |

### Important Note:

Ethnic cleansing can include genocidal violence. The categories overlap when mass killing is used to force removal or prevent return.

## Recognizing the Pattern

### Common Elements Across Cases

1. **Dehumanization:** Propaganda portrays target group as inferior, dangerous, or subhuman
2. **Legal Marginalization:** Laws strip rights, citizenship, or property protections
3. **Physical Segregation:** Ghettos, reservations, or zones concentrate population
4. **Economic Destruction:** Confiscation of assets, denial of livelihoods
5. **Forced Removal:** Mass deportations under armed guard
6. **Prevention of Return:** Homes destroyed, land redistributed, legal barriers erected

## Case Study: Yugoslav Wars (1990s)

---

## Background: Breakup of Yugoslavia

### Context (1991–1995)

**Yugoslavia** was a multi-ethnic federation created after World War I, held together under communist rule after World War II.

After the death of leader Josip Broz Tito (1980) and the collapse of communism (1989–1991), the federation began to dissolve.

### Key Groups Involved:

- **Serbs:** Largest ethnic group, Orthodox Christian
- **Croats:** Roman Catholic, declared independence in 1991
- **Bosniaks:** Muslim population, primarily in Bosnia-Herzegovina
- **Others:** Slovenes, Montenegrins, Albanians (in Kosovo), Macedonians

## Ethnic Cleansing in Bosnia (1992–1995)

### The Systematic Campaign

### Scale of Violence
- **~100,000 killed** in Bosnia-Herzegovina
- **Over 2 million displaced** (half the pre-war population)
- **Systematic rape camps** used as weapon of terror

### Methods Used:

1. **Mass Killings:** Srebrenica massacre (July 1995) — 8,000+ Bosniak men and boys executed
2. **Concentration Camps:** Civilians detained, tortured, killed (Omarska, Trnopolje camps)
3. **Forced Deportations:** Villages surrounded, residents expelled at gunpoint
4. **Destruction of Heritage:** Mosques, churches, and cultural sites demolished
5. **Sexual Violence:** Estimated 20,000–50,000 women raped, often in organized camps
6. **Siege Tactics:** Sarajevo besieged for 1,425 days (longest in modern history)

## Srebrenica Genocide (July 1995)

### What Happened?

**Srebrenica** was a UN-designated "safe area" supposedly protected by Dutch peacekeepers.

Bosnian Serb forces, led by General Ratko Mladić, overran the town in July 1995.

### The Massacre:

- Serb forces separated men and boys (ages 12–77) from women and children
- Over 8,000 Bosniak males were executed over several days
- Bodies buried in mass graves; many later reburied to hide evidence
- Women and children were forcibly expelled to Bosniak-controlled territory

### Legal Recognition:

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) ruled Srebrenica was **genocide** — the only event in the Yugoslav Wars to receive that designation.

## International Response

### How Did the World React?

#### Failures
- UN peacekeepers unable/unwilling to stop massacres
- Arms embargo prevented Bosnian self-defense
- Delayed military intervention (until 1995)
- "Safe areas" designation proved meaningless

#### Eventual Actions
- NATO airstrikes (Operation Deliberate Force, Aug–Sep 1995)
- Dayton Accords (Dec 1995) ended fighting
- ICTY created to prosecute war crimes
- Peacekeeping forces deployed to enforce peace

### Prosecutions:

161 individuals indicted by ICTY, including:
- Slobodan Milošević (Serbian president, died during trial)
- Radovan Karadžić (Bosnian Serb leader, convicted 2016)
- Ratko Mladić (military commander, convicted 2017)

## Legacy and Lessons

### What Did We Learn?

### Recognition
The Yugoslav Wars demonstrated that ethnic cleansing could happen in modern Europe despite "Never Again" promises after the Holocaust.

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Ethnic cleansing is not ancient history:** It occurs in the modern world when conditions allow
2. **State power is essential:** Systematic violence requires military, police, and logistical resources
3. **Propaganda precedes violence:** Dehumanization campaigns prepare populations to accept atrocities
4. **International law matters:** ICTY prosecutions showed perpetrators could be held accountable
5. **Early intervention saves lives:** Delayed response allowed mass atrocities to occur

## Analytical Framework: Key Questions

### How to Identify Ethnic Cleansing

When examining historical or contemporary events, ask:

1. **Is there systematic targeting of a specific group?**
2. **Does state authority direct or enable the violence?**
3. **Is the goal to remove a population from territory?**
4. **Are multiple tactics used (violence, deportation, property destruction)?**
5. **Is there prevention of return (legal, physical, or demographic)?**

### If the answer to most of these questions is "yes," you are likely examining ethnic cleansing.
