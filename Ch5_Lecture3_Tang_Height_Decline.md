# LECTURE 3: Tang at Its Height and the An Lushan Rebellion

**50 minutes | Focus: How did Tang China reach its cultural zenith even as political centralization began to crumble?**

## Structure:

### 1. **Hook** (4 minutes):
Only one woman in Chinese history declared herself emperor of her own dynasty. Empress Wu rose from concubine to ruler, eliminated rivals ruthlessly, yet Buddhism flourished and government functioned smoothly. How did she do it?

### 2. **Empress Wu's Rise to Power** (11 minutes):
- Started as concubine to Gaozong, convinced him to demote empress and promote her
- Dark legend: smothered her own baby daughter to frame the empress
- When Gaozong had stroke in 665, Wu made decisions "from behind a screen"
- Performed earth sacrifice at Mount Tai (complementing yang with yin)
- After Gaozong's death (683), deposed two sons in succession
- **690: Declared herself emperor** of new Zhou Dynasty (age 65)
- Used Buddhism to legitimate rule (Great Cloud Sutra prophecy)
- Expanded examination system, brought new men into government
- Patronized Longmen cave temples
- **Ruled until age 80**, forced to abdicate in 705

### 3. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #1** (4 minutes):
Quick Write: Why was Empress Wu's gender such a challenge to Confucian ideology? How did she use Buddhism to solve this problem?

### 4. **Xuanzong and the High Tang** (10 minutes):
- Came to throne 712 after period of female power and factionalism
- Early reign: activist reformer
  - Curbed monastery power
  - New census to shore up equal-field system
  - Set up frontier military provinces with professional armies
- Brilliant cultural court: poetry, painting, music thrived
  - Poet Li Bai served at court
  - Horse painter Han Gan
  - Interest in Daoism and Tantric Buddhism
- **Growing older, spent more time with Yang Guifei**
- Allowed her relatives to gain power
- Favorite General An Lushan spent increasing time at court

### 5. **The An Lushan Rebellion** (10 minutes):
- An Lushan: half-Sogdian, half-Turk professional soldier
- Commanded frontier army in northern Hebei since 744 (over 100,000 troops)
- Quarreled with Yang Guifei's cousin, led to open warfare (755)
- Veterans struck toward Luoyang, capital fell
- **Xuanzong fled west**; troops mutinied, killed Yang Guifei and relatives
- Heir apparent enthroned himself as new emperor
- Tang called on Uighurs to retake capital (Uighurs looted it first)
- Rebellion finally suppressed by 763, but at enormous cost

### 6. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #2** (3 minutes):
Partner Discussion: The An Lushan Rebellion killed millions and devastated China. Why do historians say we shouldn't view "late Tang" simply as dynastic decline?

### 7. **Tang Cultural Achievements and Late Tang** (5 minutes):
- **Poetry flourished throughout Tang**: 48,000 poems by 2,200 poets survive
- Li Bai: light-hearted celebration of wine, friendship, nature
- Du Fu: moral voice protesting injustice, "Confucian poet"
- Bai Juyi: accessible style, huge output
- **Fiction**: Tang tales in classical language (love stories, supernatural themes)
- Buddhism deeply embedded in daily life, but faced persecution in 845
- After rebellion: regional military governors held real power
- Salt monopoly became major revenue source
- Trade flourished as government withdrew from economy
- Confucian revival: Han Yu advocated "ancient style" prose and return to Confucian Way

### 8. **Wrap-up** (3 minutes):
The Tang created institutional frameworks and cultural achievements that would define Chinese civilization for centuries, even as political unity fragmented. The dynasty limped on until 907, but the China that emerged was profoundly transformed.

**Big Question**: Why did Tang cultural achievements reach their peak precisely when centralized political control was fragmenting?
