                    This claim is particularly important because it allowed white Southerners to avoid moral culpability for slavery while maintaining regional pride.

                    (3 minutes) According to Charles Reagan Wilson in "Baptized in Blood," the Lost Cause provided spiritual identity to white Southerners after defeat.
                    
                    Churches explicitly framed Confederate defeat as redemptive sufferingâ€”like Christ's crucifixion, it would lead to resurrection and vindication.
                    
                    This is an example of "civil religion" (term from sociologist Robert Bellah)â€”when patriotic beliefs and rituals take on religious characteristics.
                    
                    The UDC created actual catechisms that children memorized, teaching Lost Cause doctrine like religious instruction.
                    
                    This religious dimension helps explain the myth's emotional power and persistence.

                    (3 minutes) The North and South were not fundamentally different culturesâ€”both were American, Protestant, agricultural in many areas. The major difference was slavery.
                    
                    Military historians agree the South had viable paths to victory, especially through a defensive strategy. The "overwhelmed by numbers" narrative excuses strategic failures.
                    
                    Home front realities were harshâ€”about 1/3 of Confederate soldiers deserted by 1865.
                    
                    This contradicts the "unified, harmonious" home front myth.

                    1. The Lost Cause was not an innocent "Southern heritage"â€”it was a deliberate distortion designed to evade moral responsibility for slavery.
                    
                    2. Primary sources clearly show the war was about slavery, despite subsequent mythmaking.
                    
                    3. This case study teaches us to be critical consumers of historical narrativesâ€”who writes history matters, and narratives serve purposes.
                    
                    4. These myths have real consequences for how we discuss race and justice today.
                    
                    The Du Bois quote captures how the Lost Cause enabled the rollback of Black rights after Reconstruction's promise.
                    
                    Exit ticket helps assess learning: Have each student write down one myth and explain its harm.
