            <h2>Origins of the Conflict</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The institution of <strong>slavery</strong> and its expansion westward divided the nation politically and morally for decades before 1861.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Republican Party</strong> (formed 1854) opposed slavery's expansion into western territories, alarming Southern slaveholders who saw this as a threat to their "peculiar institution."</li>
                <li>The 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln—who won without carrying a single Southern state—convinced many Southerners that their interests could no longer be protected within the Union.</li>
                <li>Abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison (since the 1830s) and radical actions like John Brown's raid intensified sectional tensions and Southern fears.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Multiple factors contributed to the crisis: debates over slavery's expansion, failed compromises (Kansas-Nebraska Act 1854, Bleeding Kansas), economic differences, and fundamental disagreements about states' rights versus federal authority.</p>

            <h2>The Secession Crisis</h2>
            <div class="section-subtitle">Attempts at Compromise</div>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>Crittenden Compromise</strong> (December 1860) proposed six constitutional amendments to protect slavery forever, including restoring and extending the Missouri Compromise line (36°30') to the Pacific.</li>
                <li>Republicans, including Lincoln, rejected this plan because it contradicted their core principle of stopping slavery's expansion.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Corwin Amendment</strong> (passed Congress February-March 1861) would have made it impossible for Congress to abolish slavery where it already existed—Lincoln endorsed it, but Southern states had already begun leaving.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Meeting in Montgomery, Alabama (February 1861), delegates from the seven seceded states drafted the <strong>Confederate Constitution</strong>, which closely followed the U.S. Constitution with one crucial difference: it explicitly protected slavery.</li>
                <li>Article One, Section Nine declared that "No law impairing or denying the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed."</li>
                <li>The new Confederacy elected <strong>Jefferson Davis</strong> of Mississippi as provisional president and <strong>Alexander Stephens</strong> of Georgia as vice president.</li>
                <li>The Confederacy was structured as a <strong>confederation</strong> (loose alliance of states) rather than a federal union, to protect state sovereignty and slavery from federal interference.</li>
                <li>Despite these efforts, the CSA faced internal divisions over centralized power that would plague it throughout the war.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>After defeating Hooker at <strong>Chancellorsville</strong> (May 1863)—where Stonewall Jackson was mortally wounded—Lee decided on another Northern invasion.</li>
                <li>Lee hoped to relieve Virginia, threaten Northern cities, and win a decisive victory that might force Lincoln to negotiate peace.</li>
                <li>The armies met at <strong>Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</strong> on <span class="year-badge">July 1–3, 1863</span>—the largest battle ever fought in North America.</li>
                <li>On July 3, Lee ordered <strong>Pickett's Charge</strong>: 15,000 Confederates advanced nearly a mile across open ground against entrenched Union forces on Cemetery Ridge.</li>
                <li>More than half were killed or wounded in what proved to be a disastrous Confederate defeat.</li>
                <li>Total casualties: ~23,000 Union, ~28,000 Confederate (over <strong>50,000 total</strong>).</li>

                <li>Civilians hid in caves; residents ate their pets to survive the bombardment.</li>
                <li>On <span class="year-badge">July 3, 1863</span> (same day as Pickett's Charge), the Confederate garrison surrendered.</li>
                <li>The Union now controlled the entire Mississippi River, splitting the Confederacy in two.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>In <span class="year-badge">November 1863</span>, Lincoln traveled to Gettysburg to dedicate the new Soldiers' National Cemetery.</li>
                <li>After a two-hour speech by orator Edward Everett, Lincoln spoke for just two minutes.</li>
                <li>His <strong>Gettysburg Address</strong> redefined the war's purpose and the nation's meaning:</li>

                <p style="font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 0.8em;">Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure...</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Lincoln invoked the Declaration of Independence (1776, "four score and seven years"), not the Constitution (1787), emphasizing equality over states' rights.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The Emancipation Proclamation opened Union military service to Black men; by war's end, over <strong>190,000 African Americans</strong> had served.</li>
                <li><strong>85% were formerly enslaved people</strong> fighting for their own liberation and the end of slavery.</li>
                <li>Initially assigned to labor duties (digging trenches, hauling supplies, cooking), Black soldiers fought for the right to serve in combat.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="section-subtitle">Discrimination & Valor</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Black soldiers received only <strong>$10 per month</strong> (minus $3 for clothing) while White soldiers received <strong>$13 per month</strong> with no deductions.</li>
                <li>Abolitionists and Republican congressmen fought this injustice; in <strong>1864</strong>, Congress equalized pay and provided back pay to 1863.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts Regiment</strong>—one of the first Black units—distinguished itself at <strong>Fort Wagner, South Carolina</strong> (July 1863), assaulting a heavily fortified position with extraordinary courage.</li>
                <li>Despite proving their valor, Black soldiers faced unique dangers: Confederate forces often refused to treat them as prisoners of war.</li>

            <ul>

                <li>After Union forces surrendered, Confederates <strong>executed Black soldiers</strong> instead of taking them prisoner, while sparing White soldiers.</li>
                <li>The massacre outraged the North and the Union refused any further prisoner exchanges with the Confederacy.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The Confederacy counted on "<strong>King Cotton</strong>" to secure British and French support—both nations depended on Southern cotton for textile mills.</li>
                <li>Britain did build and sell ironclad ships to the Confederacy: the <strong>CSS Florida</strong> and <strong>CSS Alabama</strong> wreaked havoc on Union shipping (both eventually destroyed).</li>
                <li>However, European intervention never materialized as the South hoped.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="section-subtitle">Why Europe Stayed Out</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Britain</strong> had abolished slavery in 1833; public opinion strongly opposed the Confederacy after the Emancipation Proclamation.</li>
                <li>Britain found alternative cotton sources in <strong>India and Egypt</strong>, reducing dependence on the South.</li>
                <li>The Union's naval <strong>blockade</strong> made Southern trade increasingly difficult and risky.</li>
                <li>Britain feared war with the United States would mean the invasion of <strong>Canada</strong> and loss of lucrative American grain imports.</li>
                <li><strong>France's Napoleon III</strong> invaded <strong>Mexico</strong> (1861) during the war, establishing a puppet regime (1864–1867)—he used the Civil War as a distraction, not an opportunity to help the South.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="highlight-box">

                <li>Under orders to "make Georgia howl," Union soldiers destroyed railroads, burned crops and cotton, killed livestock, and looted plantations.</li>
