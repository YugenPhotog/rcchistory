                    <h2>The Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854)</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stephen Douglas proposes Nebraska territory to facilitate transcontinental railroad</li>
                        <li>Southerners demanded a southern terminus for the railroad</li>
                        <li>Nebraska territory located above the 36°30' Missouri Compromise line</li>
                        <li>Douglas's solution: "Popular Sovereignty" - let settlers decide on slavery</li>
                        <li>Act effectively repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Douglas's Kansas-Nebraska Act fundamentally altered the political landscape. By allowing popular sovereignty, it opened territory previously closed to slavery, enraging Northern voters.

                    <h2>Breaking the Missouri Compromise</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Missouri Compromise (1820) had maintained sectional peace for 34 years</li>
                        <li>Prohibited slavery north of 36°30' latitude (except Missouri)</li>
                        <li>Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed slavery in these territories through popular sovereignty</li>
                        <li>Northern outrage: seen as betrayal of sacred compact</li>
                        <li>Crisis provoked formation of new political alliances</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        The Missouri Compromise had successfully maintained an uneasy balance between free and slave states. Its repeal shattered that balance and convinced many Northerners that a "Slave Power" conspiracy was working to extend slavery everywhere.

                    <h2>Death of the Whig Party</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Whig Party fractured over Kansas-Nebraska Act</li>
                        <li>Northern Whigs opposed extension of slavery</li>
                        <li>Southern Whigs supported popular sovereignty</li>
                        <li>Party could not maintain national coalition</li>
                        <li>By 1856, Whig Party effectively ceased to exist</li>
                        <li>Created political vacuum in the North</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        The Whig Party's collapse represented the failure of national political institutions to contain sectional tensions. The party that had elected two presidents could not survive the slavery controversy.

                        <li>Founded in 1854 in response to Kansas-Nebraska Act</li>
                        <li>Coalition of anti-slavery Whigs, Democrats, and Free-Soilers</li>
                        <li>Platform: oppose extension of slavery into territories</li>
                        <li>Exclusively Northern party - no Southern support</li>
                        <li>First purely sectional major party in American history</li>
                        <li>Represented "Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        The Republican Party's emergence as a sectional party marked a dangerous development. For the first time, a major party had no presence in half the country, making sectional conflict almost inevitable.

                        <li>Two rival governments established: Topeka (free) and Lecompton (slave)</li>
                        <li>Violence erupts between competing factions</li>
                        <li>May 1856: Pro-slavery forces sack Lawrence, Kansas</li>
                        <li>Over 200 deaths in guerrilla warfare</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Popular sovereignty, meant to defuse tensions, instead created civil war in miniature. Kansas became a testing ground where North and South fought for control, foreshadowing the larger conflict to come.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Senator Charles Sumner (MA) delivers "Crime Against Kansas" speech</li>
                        <li>Personally attacks Senator Andrew Butler of South Carolina</li>
                        <li>May 22, 1856: Preston Brooks (Butler's cousin) enters Senate chamber</li>
                        <li>Brooks beats Sumner unconscious with a cane</li>
                        <li>Sumner suffers severe injuries; takes 3 years to recover</li>
                        <li>North: Sumner becomes martyr to "Slave Power" brutality</li>
                        <li>South: Brooks becomes hero; receives gift canes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        The caning of Sumner symbolized the breakdown of civil discourse. Violence had now entered the halls of Congress itself. The different reactions in North and South showed how deeply divided the nation had become.

                    <ul>
                        <li>1840-1860: 4 million immigrants arrive (Irish, Germans, Chinese)</li>
                        <li>Most sought higher wages and economic opportunity</li>
                        <li>Immigrants filled low-paying jobs in port cities</li>
                        <li>Low wages contributed to urban poverty and slums</li>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        This massive wave of immigration transformed American cities and created a new urban working class. The scale was unprecedented - nearly 15% of the U.S. population by 1860 was foreign-born.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Great Famine (1845-1850) drove mass exodus</li>
                        <li>Over 1 million Irish immigrated to escape starvation</li>
                        <li>Overwhelmingly poor and Catholic</li>
                        <li>Entered workforce young in low-paid, dangerous jobs</li>
                        <li>Faced intense discrimination and prejudice</li>
                        <li>Staunch anti-abolitionists (feared job competition)</li>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        The Irish faced the double burden of poverty and religious prejudice. Their Catholicism made them targets of Protestant nativism, while their poverty forced them into the worst jobs in industrial America.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        German immigrants were more diverse than the Irish, including both Catholics and Protestants, wealthy and poor. Their tendency to maintain German language and customs made them targets of nativist suspicion.

                        Chinese immigrants faced perhaps the most extreme discrimination. They were essential to building the transcontinental railroad but were rewarded with legal exclusion. Their contributions have been systematically minimized in American history.

                        The Panic of 1837 and resulting depressions led to business failures and job losses, making labor abundant and jobs scarce. This gave employers leverage to demand more productivity for lower wages.

                        The election of 1856 showed that American politics had become thoroughly sectionalized. The Republican Party's strong showing proved it was now a major force, setting the stage for Lincoln's victory in 1860.

                        The Supreme Court's attempt to remove slavery from politics backfired spectacularly. Instead of settling the question, it inflamed sectional tensions and convinced Northerners that Southern slaveholders controlled all branches of government.

                        The Panic of 1857 reinforced sectional stereotypes. Southerners saw it as vindication of their agricultural system, while Northerners blamed it on lack of protective tariffs. Economic crisis thus deepened political divisions.

                        Free-labor ideology gave Republicans a powerful message that united diverse constituencies. It portrayed slavery not just as morally wrong but as a threat to Northern workers' opportunity for advancement.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Book by Hinton Rowan Helper, a North Carolinian</li>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Helper's book was revolutionary because it attacked slavery from a Southern, white perspective on economic grounds. It suggested that poor whites had more in common with Northern workers than with Southern planters - a dangerous idea for the planter class.

                    <ul>
                        <li>75% of Southern whites owned no slaves</li>
                        <li>Most were small farmers on marginal land</li>
                        <li>Some were skilled craftsmen or laborers</li>
                        <li>Many aspired to own slaves someday</li>
                        <li>Supported slavery for racial and social reasons</li>
                        <li>Slavery elevated all whites above all blacks</li>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        The loyalty of non-slaveholding whites to the slave system was crucial to Southern power. Though slavery didn't benefit them economically, it gave them social status and made them fearful of black freedom. Race thus trumped class interest.

                        <li>Douglas: nationally prominent Democrat, "Little Giant"</li>

                        <li>Race attracted national attention</li>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        The Lincoln-Douglas debates were the most consequential Senate race in American history. Though Lincoln lost the election, the debates made him a national figure and set the stage for his presidential run in 1860.

                    <h2>Lincoln's "House Divided" Speech</h2>
                    <div class="quote">
                        "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved; I do not expect the house to fall; but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other."
                    </div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Delivered June 16, 1858, accepting Republican nomination</li>
                        <li>Argued current course unsustainable</li>
                        <li>Slavery would either expand everywhere or be placed on path to extinction</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Lincoln's House Divided speech was both prophetic and politically risky. He argued that Americans faced a stark choice between two incompatible social systems. His conservative advisers thought the speech too radical, but it defined the terms of debate.

                    <h2>The Lincoln-Douglas Debates</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Seven debates across Illinois (August-October 1858)</li>
                        <li>Each debate lasted three hours</li>
                        <li>Huge crowds attended (10,000-15,000 people)</li>
                        <li>Focused on slavery in territories and Dred Scott</li>
                        <li>Douglas defended popular sovereignty</li>
                        <li>Lincoln attacked slavery as morally wrong</li>
                        <li>Both opposed full racial equality (typical of era)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        The debates attracted enormous crowds and newspaper coverage. This was democracy at its finest - serious, extended discussion of the most important issues facing the nation. The quality of political discourse has rarely been matched.

                    <h2>Key Issues in the Debates</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Douglas:</strong> Popular sovereignty lets people decide</li>
                        <li><strong>Lincoln:</strong> Slavery morally wrong, must be contained</li>
                        <li><strong>Douglas:</strong> Slavery will die naturally if not protected</li>
                        <li><strong>Lincoln:</strong> Dred Scott shows slavery expanding</li>
                        <li><strong>Douglas:</strong> Republicans are radical abolitionists</li>
                        <li><strong>Lincoln:</strong> Democrats part of "Slave Power conspiracy"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        The debates clarified the fundamental disagreement between North and South. Douglas tried to find middle ground through popular sovereignty, but Lincoln argued moral questions couldn't be compromised. The debates framed the 1860 election.

                    <h2>The Freeport Doctrine</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Freeport, Illinois debate (August 27, 1858)</li>
                        <li>Lincoln posed dilemma to Douglas:</li>
                        <li>Could territories exclude slavery despite Dred Scott decision?</li>
                        <li>Douglas's response: "Freeport Doctrine"</li>
                        <li>Slavery needs positive local regulations to exist</li>
                        <li>Territories could exclude slavery by refusing protective laws</li>
                        <li>This preserved popular sovereignty despite Dred Scott</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Lincoln's Freeport question was brilliant political strategy. He forced Douglas to choose between Northern voters (who wanted to exclude slavery) and Southern Democrats (who demanded Dred Scott be respected). Douglas's answer saved his Senate seat but destroyed his presidential chances.

                    <h2>Impact of the Freeport Doctrine</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Helped Douglas win re-election in Illinois</li>
                        <li>Satisfied Northern voters who opposed slavery extension</li>
                        <li>Outraged Southern Democrats</li>
                        <li>South saw it as betrayal of Dred Scott</li>
                        <li>Made Douglas unacceptable as presidential candidate to South</li>
                        <li>Contributed to Democratic split in 1860</li>
                        <li>Lincoln lost battle but won the war</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        The Freeport Doctrine was Douglas's poison pill. By trying to appeal to Northern voters, he alienated Southern Democrats who would later split the party and hand the presidency to Lincoln. Sometimes winning the battle means losing the war.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Douglas won Senate seat (state legislature chose senators)</li>
                        <li>Republicans won popular vote in Illinois</li>
                        <li>Lincoln emerged as national Republican figure</li>
                        <li>Debates were published and widely read</li>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Though Lincoln lost the Senate race, he won something more valuable - national recognition. His performance in the debates convinced Republican leaders that he could carry crucial swing states in 1860. Sometimes losing can be the path to winning.

                        Brown learned abolitionism from his father and never wavered from it. His friendship with a black boy during the War of 1812 convinced him that blacks were not inferior. Unlike most abolitionists, Brown was willing to use violence.

                        Pottawatomie was brutal terrorism. Brown murdered five men who had not personally harmed him, choosing them for their pro-slavery views. This was political violence designed to terrorize his enemies. It worked.

                        Before Pottawatomie, abolitionists could be dismissed as impractical idealists. After it, they seemed dangerous and violent. This played into Southern fears of slave rebellion and convinced many that the North wanted to destroy them.

                        Brown's raid was tactically successful initially but strategically flawed. He captured the arsenal easily but had no escape plan. He seemed to expect slaves would spontaneously rise up - they didn't. He was trapped in the armory he had seized.

                        <li>Brown captured and imprisoned</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        The raid was a complete military failure. No slave rebellion materialized. Most of Brown's men were killed or captured. Yet this tactical defeat became a strategic victory for the antislavery cause. Brown would do more damage to slavery from the gallows than he did from the arsenal.

                        Brown's trial made him a martyr. His dignity, eloquence, and moral certainty impressed even his enemies. His willingness to die for his beliefs gave him moral authority that his violent actions alone could not. He became larger than life.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Before Harpers Ferry, abolitionism was not quite respectable even in the North. By taking armed action, Brown made verbal antislavery seem moderate. By dying for the cause, he became a saint. Ralph Waldo Emerson said Brown made the gallows "glorious like the cross."

                        Harpers Ferry was the South's 9/11 - a traumatic attack that changed everything. The fact that many Northerners praised Brown convinced Southerners that the North wanted to destroy them. Any hope for sectional reconciliation died with John Brown.

The punishment of John Brown may consolidate slavery in Virginia, but it will certainly shatter the American Democracy. You preserve your shame but you kill your glory."

                        Hugo understood what Americans could not yet see: Brown's death would make compromise impossible. Europe watched in horror as America executed a man for trying to free slaves. The moral high ground was shifting decisively against the South.
