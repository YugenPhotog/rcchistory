<section><h2>Slide 2</h2>
<h1>The Creation of Leisure Time</h1>
<div>
<div>
<h2>Pre-1815: Traditional Work Patterns</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seasonal rhythms</strong> governed agricultural work</li>
<li><strong>Task-based labor</strong> in artisan shops</li>
<li>Work and life intermingled</li>
<li>No clear division between "work time" and "free time"</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Post-1815: Industrial Time</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Factory bells</strong> regulate the working day</li>
<li><strong>Wage labor</strong> creates fixed schedules</li>
<li>Separation of work time from free time</li>
<li>The working day creates its opposite: <strong>Leisure Time</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Structured Time Off:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sundays (Sabbath observance)</li>
<li>Evenings after work</li>
<li>Saturday half-holidays (emerging practice)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>New Question:</strong> What do you do when you're not working?</p>
</div>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 3</h2>
<h1>The Middle Class and Respectable Recreation</h1>
<div>
<div>
<h2>The New Middle Class</h2>
<div>
<div>
<strong>Who They Are</strong>
<p>Clerks, shopkeepers, small manufacturers, professionals</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>What They Gain</strong>
<p>Leisure time and discretionary spending power</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Leisure as Status Marker</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>How you spend your free time signals who you are</strong></p>
<p>Leisure becomes a way to perform and display middle-class identity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>The Feminization of Respectability</h2>
<div>
<p><em>Middle-class women</em> became powerful symbols of moral refinement. Their presence in museums, lyceums, and theaters helped define which amusements were “safe,” “improving,” and socially acceptable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Visibility in public space became part of performing respectability.</li>
<li>Women’s taste shaped the boundary between “refined” and “vulgar.”</li>
<li>Leisure became a language of virtue as much as class.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<img alt="Middle-class women visiting a museum—moral presence in the public sphere, c. 1840s" src="images/Slide_3–Respectable_Recreation_Middle_Class_Women.jpg"/>
<p>
<em>Respectability performed in public: women at a museum.</em>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Popular “Improving” Amusements</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Museums</strong> (natural history, curiosities)</li>
<li><strong>Moral lectures</strong> and lyceums</li>
<li><strong>Theater</strong> (the “right” kind—respectable venues)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Affordability</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Barnum’s Museum:</strong> ~$0.25 admission</li>
<li><strong>Theater galleries:</strong> $0.50–$1.00</li>
</ul>
<h2>Geography of Respectability</h2>
<div>
<div>
<h4>Broadway Theaters</h4>
<p>Upscale venues catering to middle-class tastes and values</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Astor Place Opera House</h4>
<p>Elite uptown venue symbolizing refined culture</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Respectable recreation</strong> fused class aspiration with moral performance—on public display.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 4</h2>
<h1>The Working-Class City: Conditions</h1>
<div>
<div>
<h2>Immigration Wave</h2>
<p>Massive waves of <strong>Irish and German immigrants</strong> crowd into cities</p>
<h2>Working Conditions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Factory workers:</strong> 12–14 hour days, dangerous machinery</li>
<li><strong>Dockhands:</strong> Heavy physical labor, irregular employment</li>
<li><strong>Day laborers:</strong> Casual work, no job security</li>
<li>Low wages, no benefits</li>
<li>Child labor common</li>
</ul>
<h2>Living Conditions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overcrowding:</strong> Multiple families per room</li>
<li><strong>Slums:</strong> Poor sanitation, disease</li>
<li>Tenement buildings with no running water</li>
<li>High mortality rates</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<img alt="Working-class city tenement conditions" src="images/Slide_4 –The_Working-Class_City.png"/>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 5</h2>
<h1>The Hunger for Spectacle</h1>
<div>
<div>
<strong>Urban Density Creates Mass Audiences</strong>
<p>Concentration of people in cities produces unprecedented demand for novelty and sensation</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Media Saturation</strong>
<p>Newspapers and posters saturate public space; the city itself becomes a theater</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Performance of Identity</strong>
<p>Citizens perform their identity through choices of amusement—where you go and what you see defines who you are</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Americans across classes crave spectacle but disagree on what forms are legitimate</p>
</div>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 6</h2>
<h1>The Working-Class City:<br/>Bowery · Fire Companies · Five Points</h1>
<div>

</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visible working-class culture</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bowery Theatre:</strong> 12¢ tickets (affordable)</li>
<li><strong>Gangs &amp; swagger:</strong> The “Bowery B’hoy” style</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Fire Companies</h4>
<div>
<img alt="Volunteer fire company group portrait" src="images/Slide_7–Bowery_Fire_Companies_group_portrait.jpg"/>
<img alt="Fire scene with fire wagon and crowds" src="images/Slide_7–Bowery_Fire_Companies_fire_scene.jpg"/>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volunteer brigades:</strong> civic service + identity</li>
<li><strong>Ward politics:</strong> ties to Democratic machines</li>
<li><strong>Masculine performance:</strong> courage, rivalry</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Five Points</h4>
<div>
<img alt="Five Points intersection" src="images/Slide_8–Five_Points_intersection_painting.jpg"/>
<img alt="Five Points tenement street" src="images/Slide_8–Five_Points_tenement_street_view.jpg"/>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infamous slum</strong> in middle-class imagination</li>
<li><strong>Underground amusements:</strong> cockfights, dance halls</li>
<li><strong>Community &amp; survival:</strong> families, mutual aid</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 7</h2>
<h1>The Democratic Paradox of Taste</h1>
<div>
<p><strong>Both middle and working classes claim to speak for "the people"</strong></p>
</div>
<h2>Class Division Through Entertainment</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distinct amusements</strong> in distinct geographies</li>
<li><strong>Separate cultures</strong> with different values and aesthetics</li>
<li>Each class claims democratic legitimacy</li>
</ul>
<h2>When Worlds Collide</h2>
<div>
<div>
<h4>Overlap</h4>
<p><strong>Barnum's Museum:</strong> Cross-class appeal through clever marketing and multiple levels of meaning</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Violent Collision</h4>
<p><strong>Astor Place Riot (1849):</strong> Class warfare erupts at theater over competing claims to Shakespeare</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Your choice of theater is simultaneously a <strong>class statement</strong>, a <strong>cultural performance</strong>, and a <strong>political act</strong></p>
</div>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 8</h2>
<h1>Setting the Stage:<br/>The Urban Public Sphere</h1>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 9</h2>
<h1>The City as Theater</h1>
<h2>Post-1815 Urbanization</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rapid growth</strong> of cities creates new forms of sociability</li>
<li><strong>Novelty and change</strong> become constant features of urban life</li>
<li>Streets become stages for social performance</li>
</ul>
<h2>Media Turn Streets into Stages</h2>
<div>
<div>
<strong>Playbills and Posters</strong>
<p>Colorful advertisements plaster walls and buildings</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Newspapers</strong>
<p>Daily coverage of theatrical performances, scandals, and sensations</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Street Performance</strong>
<p>Walking Broadway or the Bowery means encountering performance at every turn</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Urban space becomes a place to see and be seen</strong></p>
<p>The city itself is theatrical—everyone is both performer and audience</p>
</div>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 10</h2>
<h1>The Public Sphere Becomes Performative</h1>
<h2>Traditional Ideal of Public Sphere</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Rational debate</strong> in coffeehouses, salons, and through newspapers</p>
<p>Citizens participate through <strong>reading and reasoned discussion</strong></p>
<p>Enlightenment model: Ideas triumph through logical argument</p>
</div>
<h2>The Shift: Democracy as Spectacle</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>From rational debate toward spectacle and display</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Democracy means having the right to <strong>watch, judge, and participate</strong> in public amusements</li>
<li>Citizens act by <strong>seeing and being seen</strong>, not just by reading and debating</li>
<li>Identity is <strong>performed</strong> through your choice of amusement and your physical presence</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>New Rules of Citizenship</h2>
<div>
<div>
<strong>Citizenship Through Spectatorship</strong>
<p>Participating by attending, watching, and judging public entertainment</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Identity Through Performance</strong>
<p>Your identity is performed through where you go and how you behave there</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Representing "The People"</strong>
<p>Different entertainment venues = different claims about who represents "the people"</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Public culture becomes <strong>contested terrain</strong> for representing "the people"</p>
</div>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 11</h2>
<h1>Race on Stage: Minstrelsy and the Invention of “Blackness”</h1>
<div>
<div>
<h2>What It Was</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blackface minstrelsy (1830s–1850s):</strong> White performers in burnt-cork makeup staging caricatured “Blackness.”</li>
<li><strong>Origins:</strong> Bowery &amp; working-class venues; popularized by acts like T. D. Rice’s “Jim Crow.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>What It Did</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invented racial types:</strong> Codified stereotypes as mass entertainment.</li>
<li><strong>Class performance:</strong> Claimed to represent “the people” while mocking elites <em>and</em> Black Americans.</li>
<li><strong>Public sphere as spectacle:</strong> Laughter and judgment as civic participation.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><strong>Key Throughline:</strong> Minstrelsy links Bowery amusements to Barnum’s commercial spectacle—democracy performed through race.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
                Image Placeholder — period lithograph or playbill (e.g., Dan Emmett troupe)

</div>
<p>
<em>Blackface troupe advertisement, c. 1840s—codifying racial caricature for mass audiences.</em>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> How can a culture claim democratic authenticity while staging race as ridicule?</p>
</div>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 12</h2>
<h1>Blood Sports, Boxing,<br/>and Working-Class Masculinity</h1>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 13</h2>
<h1>Blood Sports as Rough Amusement</h1>
<div>
<img alt="Cockfighting ring with spectators" src="images/Slide_15–Blood_Sports_cockfighting_ring.jpg"/>
</div>
<h2>Types of Blood Sports</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cockfighting:</strong> Roosters fitted with metal spurs fight to the death</li>
<li><strong>Dogfights:</strong> Pit bulls and terriers battle in underground rings</li>
<li><strong>Rat-baiting:</strong> Dogs kill as many rats as possible in a pit</li>
<li><strong>Bare-knuckle fights:</strong> Human boxing without gloves, few rules</li>
</ul>
<h2>Social Meaning</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Working-class masculine sociability</strong> and defiance of middle-class restraint</p>
<ul>
<li>Held in Five Points and Bowery taverns, cellars, and back rooms</li>
<li>Heavy gambling on outcomes</li>
<li>Often illegal yet widely practiced</li>
<li>Entrepreneurs monetize despite reformers' opposition</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>Sets the stage for the culture of the <strong>prize ring</strong></p>
</div>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 14</h2>
<h1>Boxing and the Culture of the Prize Ring</h1>
<h2>The Sporting Fraternity</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Bare-knuckle prizefighting:</strong> Illegal, staged in secret venues</p>
<p><strong>"The fancy"</strong> or <strong>"sporting men"</strong>—subculture of fight enthusiasts</p>
</div>
<h2>Who Were the Sporting Men?</h2>
<div>
<p>Diffuse subculture around prizefighting spanning urban America</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working-class men:</strong> butchers, mechanics, firemen, tavern keepers</li>
<li>Across different ethnic backgrounds but united by sporting culture</li>
<li>Found in every major city from New York to New Orleans</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Shared Culture of "The Fancy"</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sports newspapers:</strong> <em>Spirit of the Times</em> and similar publications</li>
<li><strong>Tavern gatherings:</strong> Discussion and planning of matches</li>
<li><strong>Insider slang:</strong> Specialized vocabulary marking membership</li>
<li><strong>"Flash" style:</strong> Distinctive dress and swagger</li>
<li><strong>Fan identity:</strong> Following fights, knowing fighters, attending matches</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Prizefighting creates a <strong>working-class male counterpublic</strong>—an alternative public sphere with its own values and heroes</p>
</div>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 15</h2>
<h1>Physical Mastery as Democratic Metaphor</h1>
<div>
<div>
<strong>Virtue Proven in the Ring</strong>
<p>Rather than by birth or wealth, a man's worth is demonstrated through physical courage and skill</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>The Masculine Body as Site of Value</strong>
<p>The body becomes the site of value and citizenship—physical prowess equals democratic legitimacy</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Rejection of Elite Values</strong>
<p>Rejection of "refinement" and self-restraint as elite values—toughness, not polish, defines the man</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Democratic Ideology of the Prize Ring</h3>
<p>In the ring, all men are equal—only strength, skill, and courage matter. Birth and wealth count for nothing. The working-class body becomes a <strong>democratic symbol</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>The prize ring offers an alternative vision of American democracy</strong>—one based on physical prowess rather than property or education</p>
</div>

<section><h2>Slide 16</h2>
<h1>P. T. Barnum:<br/>The Art of Humbug</h1>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 17</h2>
<h1>Barnum's American Museum (1841–1865)</h1>
<div>
<img alt="Barnum's American Museum exterior" src="images/Slide_19–Barnums_Museum_exterior.jpg"/>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div>
<p>Established in <strong>1841</strong>, Barnum's five-story museum attracted <strong>over 15 million visitors</strong> during its 24-year run</p>
</div>
<h2>What Was Inside?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural curiosities:</strong> Stuffed animals, geological specimens, natural oddities</li>
<li><strong>Living "human wonders":</strong> People with unusual physical characteristics</li>
<li><strong>Theatrical performances:</strong> Plays, musical acts, variety shows</li>
<li><strong>Scientific lectures:</strong> Educational talks (allegedly)</li>
<li><strong>Elaborate hoaxes:</strong> Fake mermaids, questionable artifacts</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hybrid Institution</h2>
<div>
<p>A unique combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moral lecture hall</li>
<li>Curiosity cabinet</li>
<li>Theater</li>
<li>"Freak show"</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Cross-Class Appeal</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broadway location:</strong> Respectable enough for middle-class families</li>
<li><strong>Low admission (~$0.25):</strong> Affordable for working-class visitors</li>
<li><strong>Cross-gender appeal:</strong> Women and children explicitly welcomed</li>
<li>Marketed as educational and moral</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 18</h2>
<h1>Humbug as an Art Form</h1>
<h2>Famous Hoaxes</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<strong>Joice Heth (1835)</strong>
<p>Elderly Black woman Barnum claimed was 161 years old and George Washington's former nurse. Obviously false, but thousands paid to see her.</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Feejee Mermaid (1842)</strong>
<p>Taxidermy creation combining a monkey torso with a fish tail. Barnum presented it as authentic with fake scientific credentials.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<h2>What Is Humbug?</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Humbug:</strong> A blend of education, fraud, and emotional manipulation</p>
<ul>
<li>Not simple deception—audiences know they might be fooled</li>
<li>The <strong>desire to be deceived</strong> is part of the pleasure</li>
<li>Spectacle of <strong>belief and doubt</strong> performed publicly</li>
<li>Value measured by <strong>experience</strong> rather than authenticity</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>The question isn't "Is it real?" but "Is it worth my quarter?"</strong></p>
</div>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 19</h2>
<h1>Democratizing Curiosity and Emotion</h1>
<h2>Barnum's Democratic Genius</h2>
<div>
<div>
<strong>Everyone Can Play</strong>
<p>Everyone can participate in the game of belief and doubt—you don't need education or refinement</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Performing Sophistication</strong>
<p>Audiences perform sophistication by debating authenticity with each other</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Commercialization of Wonder</strong>
<p>Commercialization of wonder and feeling forms a public around shared experience</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Creating "The Public"</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Shared spectacular experiences produce "the public"</strong></p>
<p>Strangers become a community through common experience of spectacle, debate, and collective judgment</p>
</div>
<h2>Persistent Tension</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Democratization vs. Exploitation</strong></p>
<p>Does Barnum empower audiences or manipulate them? Does he democratize culture or commercialize human dignity?</p>
</div>
</section>
<section><h2>Slide 20</h2>
<h1>Barnum's Rhetoric and Politics</h1>
<h2>The Paradox of Barnum</h2>
<div>
<div>
<h4>What Barnum Claims</h4>
<ul>
<li>Moral uplift and education</li>
<li>Family-friendly entertainment</li>
<li>Democratizing high culture</li>
<li>Making wonder accessible</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h4>What Barnum Does</h4>
<ul>
<li>Traffics in mockery and sensation</li>
<li>Exploits human difference</li>
<li>Profits from deception</li>
<li>Commercializes everything</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Democratic Achievements</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low prices:</strong> Makes culture accessible across class lines</li>
<li><strong>Broad access:</strong> Welcomes women, children, working class</li>
<li><strong>Participatory culture:</strong> Audiences actively debate and judge</li>
<li><strong>Meritocracy of pleasure:</strong> Your enjoyment is what matters, not your refinement</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Problematic Aspects</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exploitation:</strong> Displays people with disabilities as "freaks"</li>
<li><strong>Racial mockery:</strong> Perpetuates racist stereotypes (Joice Heth)</li>
<li><strong>Deception for profit:</strong> Capitalizes on gullibility</li>
<li><strong>Commercialization:</strong> Everything becomes commodity</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Barnum represents both the promise and the problems of democratic commercial culture</strong></p>
<p>He democratizes access but also exploits vulnerability. He empowers audiences but also manipulates them. He challenges elite culture but creates new hierarchies of his own.</p>
