                    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; color: white; line-height: 1.8;">The Second Great Awakening democratized American religion, empowering ordinary people with spiritual authority and fueling social reform movements. This religious transformation reshaped American culture, giving rise to the Northern middle class with its values of self-discipline, moral improvement, and economic ambition. Yet these ideals—including the Cult of Domesticity—primarily served white, middle-class interests, excluding working-class, immigrant, and Black women from respectability's privileges while using moral language to justify social hierarchies.</p>
