                    Welcome to Lecture 2. Today we examine the Second Great Awakening and its profound impact on American culture, including the emergence of the Northern middle class and the Cult of Domesticity. The lecture is divided into three parts: religious revival, social reform, and domestic ideals. To engage students, start with a question: 'How might religious movements like this influence modern American society, such as through social media or community activism?'

                    The Second Great Awakening began in the 1790s and lasted until the 1850s. Unlike the First Great Awakening, this movement was more democratic and emotional. Key denominations were Methodists and Baptists. It produced entirely new religious movements and established a providential worldview that shaped American culture. Engage students by asking: 'Can you think of modern examples of mass gatherings that inspire personal change, like music festivals or protests?'

<aside class="notes">
    <p>Charles Grandison Finney was the most influential revivalist, especially among the northern middle class. A former lawyer, he emphasized free will—anyone could choose salvation. He promoted perfectionism—living without sin. His revivals led directly to reform movements, especially abolitionism. His emphasis on human agency fit perfectly with northern middle-class values. To engage students, discuss: 'How does Finney's idea of personal choice in faith mirror today's self-help culture?'</p>

    <h3>Arminianism</h3>
    <p>Jacobus Arminius began as a devoted Calvinist theologian, trained under Theodore Beza—the successor to John Calvin in Geneva. Yet over time, Arminius grew uneasy with the strict determinism he saw in Calvinist teaching, especially the idea of <strong>double predestination</strong>, which held that God had eternally chosen some people for salvation and others for damnation. Arminius believed this interpretation of divine sovereignty conflicted with God’s justice and love, and undermined genuine human responsibility. His goal was not to overthrow Calvinism but to <strong>reform it from within</strong>, preserving its respect for divine grace while restoring room for human choice and moral accountability.</p>

    <p>After Arminius’s death in 1609, his followers formalized his ideas in a statement known as the <strong>Remonstrance of 1610</strong>, outlining five key points that challenged Calvinist orthodoxy. They argued for conditional election, resistible grace, and universal atonement—beliefs emphasizing that salvation was available to all who freely accepted it. This document directly responded to Calvinist theology, seeking to correct what the Arminians saw as an imbalance that made God appear arbitrary and humanity powerless. In short, <strong>Arminianism was a direct theological reaction</strong> to Calvinism’s emphasis on divine predestination.</p>

    <p>The controversy came to a head at the <strong>Synod of Dort (1618–1619)</strong>, where church leaders rejected Arminianism and codified what became known as the <strong>Five Points of Calvinism</strong>—summarized by the acronym <em>TULIP</em>. Ironically, these Calvinist points only took their definitive form in response to the Arminian challenge. Though condemned at Dort, Arminian thought survived and flourished, especially through <strong>John Wesley</strong> and the <strong>Methodist movement</strong>, shaping much of modern evangelical Christianity. In this way, Arminianism stands as both a protest and a legacy—an enduring effort to reconcile God’s sovereignty with human freedom.</p>

                    The awakening democratized religion by breaking down clerical authority, emphasizing emotion over intellect, and rejecting predestination for free will. This opened doors for women and African Americans to gain religious authority even when they lacked political rights. Religious democratization paralleled and reinforced America's political democratization in the Jacksonian era. Why this reframing: Wood views religion as a stabilizing force for republican ideals, integrating diverse groups into a cohesive national culture, while Johnson sees it as fostering moral discipline essential for social order. Why emphasize African American contributions: Johnson emphasizes evangelicalism’s role in creating a moral economy that included diverse groups, while Wood sees Black religious participation as part of the republic’s voluntary associations. Why integrate minorities: Wood integrates diverse groups into a unified republican narrative, while Johnson sees minorities as part of the moral economy, not separate victims. Engage students: 'Discuss in pairs: How did African American churches like the AME contribute to community building in ways similar to modern social networks?'

                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The SGA’s providential worldview, embraced by diverse groups including African Americans, inspired Americans to see history as guided by divine purpose, motivating reforms like temperance and abolition as acts of national moral duty.</p>

                    Industrialization created separate spheres: men in public (market, politics), women in private (home, religion). The Cult of Domesticity defined ideal womanhood: piety, purity, domesticity, submission. Women were moral anchors but excluded from politics and commerce. Paradoxically, this ideology both limited and empowered women—it created space for activism in reform movements. Why this presentation: Wood sees domestic ideals as reinforcing republican motherhood, while Johnson views them as fostering discipline for economic and social progress.

                    The Cult of Domesticity was a middle-class ideal requiring leisure and financial stability. Working-class women worked in factories, mills, and domestic service with long hours and low pay. They couldn't afford to stay home. The Lowell Mill Girls organized early labor protests, showing resistance to exploitation. Free Black women, such as Sarah Mapps Douglass, strengthened the SGA by leading schools and reform efforts, contributing to the national rise in evangelical moral influence alongside other women. Why this integration and positive framing: Wood sees domestic ideals as reinforcing republican motherhood, while Johnson views them as fostering discipline for economic and social progress. Why integrate minorities: Wood integrates diverse groups into a unified republican narrative, while Johnson sees minorities as part of the moral economy, not separate victims.

                        <p>A "true woman" was gentle, submissive, and acquiescent. Expected to defer to father and husband in all matters—strength shown through yielding.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 1.1em;">It gave women moral authority and a sphere of influence, but it also confined them to the home and justified their exclusion from politics, higher education, and economic independence.</p>

                    The four cardinal virtues: Piety (spiritual guardians), Purity (sexual virtue), Submissiveness (deference), Domesticity (home as domain). This was a white middle-class ideal that didn't reflect most women's reality. Critical question: it both empowered (moral authority) and restricted (confined to home, excluded from politics and economic independence).
