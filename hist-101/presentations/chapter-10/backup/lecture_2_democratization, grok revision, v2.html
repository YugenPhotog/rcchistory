                    The Second Great Awakening represents a pivotal transformation in American religious culture, moving from elite-controlled, rationalist religion toward democratic, emotionally accessible faith.
                    
                    Background Context (Religion in the Early Republic, 1790s):
                    - Church membership was declining post-Revolution
                    - Deism and rationalism were popular among elites
                    - Traditional clergy were losing influence
                    - Westward expansion was creating new, unchurched communities
                    - Fear of moral decay and irreligion
                    - Concern about social disorder on the frontier
                    - Desire to preserve Christian identity in new nation
                    - Growing tension between elite theology and popular piety
                    
                    This anxiety about religious decline and social disorder created fertile ground for revival. Wood emphasizes republican virtue concerns, while Johnson highlights market anxieties and the need for moral order.
                    
                    Camp meetings democratized religion by bringing it out of elite-controlled churches into open fields where ordinary people could participate. Itinerant preachers bypassed traditional authority structures. Emotional worship validated popular religious experience. Arminian theology empowered individuals.
                    
                    Engage students: 'Think-Pair-Share: Why might emotional, accessible religion appeal more to ordinary Americans than intellectual theology?'

                    Finney professionalized revival techniques and brought them to urban areas. He emphasized that conversion could be engineered through proper methods—very American, very practical. Wood sees Finney as creating republican moral citizens. Johnson views him as disciplining labor for capitalism. 
                    
                    Theological Context - Arminianism and Free Will:
                    Traditional Calvinism taught predestination: God predestines who will be saved (the "elect"), humans cannot earn or choose salvation, grace is irresistible and limited, and religious authority rests with trained clergy who interpret God's will.
                    
                    Arminianism (Free Will) offered a democratic alternative: Universal grace—salvation available to all who choose it; Human agency—individuals can accept or reject grace; Optimistic anthropology—humans capable of moral improvement; Democratic implications—everyone has equal access to God's grace.
                    
                    Revival preachers commonly said: "You are not helpless sinners waiting for God's inscrutable decree. You can choose salvation today!" Arminianism democratized salvation by making it a choice rather than predetermined fate. This empowered ordinary people and validated individual religious experience. Wood sees this as republican theology. Johnson views it as creating responsible moral actors for the market.

                    Religious reform movements represent democratization in action—ordinary people organizing to change society. Wood sees this as republican virtue. Johnson views it as creating moral discipline for market economy. 
                    
                    These movements show how religious democratization led to social activism. Ordinary people—especially women—organized to change society. Wood sees this as republican virtue. Johnson views it as moral discipline for market economy.

            <!-- Introduction to Cult of Domesticity -->
            <section>
                <h2>The "Cult of Domesticity" (or "Cult of True Womanhood")</h2>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A middle-class ideology that defined women's proper role as centered in the home, separate from the public world of men</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Historical Context</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Period:</strong> Roughly 1820s–1860s (but legacy persists)</li>
                    <li><strong>Social change:</strong> Industrialization moved work out of home</li>
                    <li><strong>Gender separation:</strong> Men in public sphere (work, politics), women in private sphere (home, family)</li>
                    <li><strong>Class marker:</strong> Only middle/upper-class women could afford to stay home</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="feature-list">
                    <div class="feature-item">
                        <strong>Piety</strong>
                        <p>Women viewed as inherently more religious and moral than men. Spiritual guardians of the family who maintained household faith and morality.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-item">
                        <strong>Purity</strong>
                        <p>Sexual virtue essential for women's moral authority. Purity was a reflection of character and the foundation of respectability. Loss of purity meant social ruin.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-item">
                        <strong>Submissiveness</strong>
                        <p>A "true woman" was gentle, submissive, and acquiescent. Expected to defer to father and husband in all matters—strength shown through yielding.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-item">
                        <strong>Domesticity</strong>
                        <p>Women's rightful domain was the home. Excellence in household management, child-rearing, and creating a moral refuge from the corrupt public world.</p>
                    </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Primarily a white middle-class ideal that did not reflect the lived reality of most American women.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Critical Question</h3>
                <p>How did this ideal both <strong>empower</strong> and <strong>restrict</strong> women?</p>
                <p>It gave women moral authority and a sphere of influence, but it also confined them to the home and justified their exclusion from politics, higher education, and economic independence.</p>
                <aside class="notes">
                    The Cult of Domesticity was both empowering and restrictive. It gave women moral authority but confined them to the home. Wood sees it as reinforcing republican motherhood. Johnson views it as creating disciplined families for market economy. 
                    
                    The four cardinal virtues show the paradox of the Cult of Domesticity—it elevated women's moral status while restricting their opportunities. Wood emphasizes republican motherhood. Johnson highlights moral discipline for capitalism.

                <aside class="notes">
                    The home became a moral refuge and miniature church. Women gained spiritual authority but were confined to domestic sphere. Wood sees this as republican motherhood.

                <p>The language of virtue and woman's sphere defined class identity but excluded most women from its privileges.

                <h3>Key Insight</h3>
                <p>Domesticity was about class identity and racial privilege, not universal womanhood. It both empowered (moral authority) and restricted (confined to home, excluded from politics and economic independence).</p>

                    Summary: domesticity included white middle-class northern women with economic security. It excluded working-class, immigrant, free Black, and enslaved women.
