                    The Second Great Awakening began in the 1790s on the frontier and spread nationwide by the 1850s. Unlike the First Great Awakening of the 1730s-40s, this movement was more democratic and emotional. Key features included mass outdoor revivals, a rejection of formal clerical authority, and the explosive growth of Methodist and Baptist churches. This movement also gave birth to entirely new religious movements like Mormonism and Adventism. The Awakening coincided with American democratization and shared its populist spirit.

                    Charles Grandison Finney was the most influential revivalist of the Second Great Awakening, particularly among the northern middle class. A former lawyer, Finney brought the awakening to cities like Rochester, NY, in the 1830s. His Arminian theology emphasized free will—anyone could choose salvation. He promoted "perfectionism," the idea that Christians could live without sin. Finney's revivals led directly to reform movements, especially abolitionism. His emphasis on human agency and moral improvement fit perfectly with northern middle-class values.

                    The Cane Ridge Revival of 1801 in Kentucky symbolizes the explosive nature of frontier revivals. An estimated 20,000 people gathered for days of preaching, singing, and emotional religious experiences including "the jerks" and other physical manifestations. Methodist circuit riders were key to spreading the awakening—young, energetic preachers who rode horseback across vast territories, preaching in homes, barns, and outdoor settings. They used simple, emotional language rather than complex theology, making Christianity accessible to ordinary frontier settlers.

                <ul>

                    <li>Preaching became <strong>emotional, direct, and plainspoken</strong> rather than intellectual</li>
                    <li><strong>Rejection of Calvinist Predestination</strong> – Emphasis on individual choice and free will</li>

                <aside class="notes">
                    The Second Great Awakening democratized American religion in several ways. First, it broke down clerical authority—you didn't need seminary training to preach or lead. This opened doors for women and African Americans to gain religious authority even when they lacked political rights. Second, it emphasized emotion over intellect, making faith accessible to all classes. Third, it rejected Calvinist predestination in favor of free will—everyone could choose salvation. This religious democratization paralleled and reinforced America's political democratization in the Jacksonian era.

They challenged conventional society and promoted individual spiritual autonomy. Many come-outer communities connected to broader reform movements like abolitionism and women's rights.

                    The Shakers were one of the most successful utopian communities of the era. Founded by Ann Lee, a working-class English woman who claimed to be the female embodiment of Christ. Shakers practiced celibacy, communal property ownership, and gender equality—all radical for the time. Their worship included ecstatic dancing (hence "Shakers"). They were famous for their simple, elegant furniture and architecture. At their peak in the mid-1800s, they had about 6,000 members in 19 communities. Their celibacy requirement meant they could only grow through conversions and adoptions, leading to their eventual decline.

                    Mormonism emerged from the religious ferment of the Second Great Awakening in upstate New York's "Burned-Over District." Joseph Smith claimed to receive golden plates from an angel, which he translated as the Book of Mormon. The faith combined Christian theology with new scripture claiming ancient Israelites migrated to America. Mormons faced violent persecution wherever they settled—partly due to their distinct beliefs, but also due to their practice of polygamy, their political cohesion, and their economic success. After Smith's murder in 1844, Brigham Young led most followers to Utah, where they established a thriving religious commonwealth.

                    William Miller, a Baptist farmer-preacher, studied the Bible intensively and calculated that Christ would return between 1843-44. His movement attracted tens of thousands who sold their property and prepared for the Second Coming. When October 22, 1844 passed without Christ's return, it became known as the "Great Disappointment." Rather than disappearing, Millerism spawned several new denominations. Seventh-day Adventists reinterpreted Miller's prophecy, claiming Christ did enter a heavenly sanctuary on that date. This shows how religious movements can survive and adapt even after dramatic prophetic failures.

                <aside class="notes">
                    The Oneida Community was one of the most radical utopian experiments of the era. John Humphrey Noyes believed in perfectionism—that humans could live without sin. His community practiced "complex marriage" where every adult was married to every other adult, with no exclusive relationships. They also practiced eugenic breeding ("stirpiculture") where the community decided who could have children together. Despite these radical practices, Oneida was economically successful, manufacturing animal traps and silverware. External pressure eventually forced them to abandon complex marriage, and they reorganized as a conventional business. The silverware company survives today as a reminder of this utopian experiment.

                    African American Christianity developed along two tracks. In the North, free Blacks established independent churches like the AME Church, which became centers of community life and abolitionist activity. In the South, enslaved people practiced both "visible" religion (attending white churches) and "invisible" religion (secret gatherings in "hush harbors"). Enslaved Christians emphasized Old Testament themes of liberation—the Exodus, Moses, the Promised Land. Spirituals contained coded messages about freedom. Black Christianity became both a source of hope and a language of resistance, providing moral authority to challenge slavery's legitimacy.

                    Women were the majority of converts in the Second Great Awakening and became crucial to its spread. Though most denominations still banned female ordination, women served as exhorters, prayer leaders, Sunday school teachers, and missionary organizers. Figures like Phoebe Palmer and Jarena Lee achieved significant influence as preachers and writers. This religious authority gave women a public voice when they lacked political rights. Evangelical religion emphasized moral equality and gave women organizational experience. Many early feminists came from evangelical backgrounds and used religious arguments to support women's rights. The religious activism of the awakening was a crucial stepping stone to organized feminism.

                <aside class="notes">
                    The Second Great Awakening sparked widespread reform movements. Evangelical perfectionism taught that individuals could be perfected through conversion—so why not perfect society too? Postmillennialists believed Christ would return after Christians created a perfect society, giving religious urgency to reform work. This logic drove temperance campaigns, abolitionism, education reform, prison reform, women's rights, and peace movements. Reformers saw their work as preparing for Christ's return. This is why so many reform movements of the antebellum era had religious roots and used religious language and moral arguments.

                    Transcendentalism emerged in the 1830s-40s among New England intellectuals, particularly around Boston and Concord. Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau were its most famous figures. Transcendentalists believed divinity existed within each person, not in institutions. They trusted intuition over reason, saw nature as divine, and emphasized individual self-reliance and conscience. While rejecting traditional Christianity, they shared the era's optimism about human potential and perfectibility. Many Transcendentalists were abolitionists and social reformers. Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience," written after refusing to pay taxes to support the Mexican-American War, became a foundational text for nonviolent resistance movements worldwide.

                    The Burned-Over District in upstate New York was America's most religiously innovative region in the antebellum period. The Erie Canal (1825) brought rapid economic change and social disruption. New Englanders migrated west, bringing diverse religious traditions but no strong established churches. This created fertile ground for religious experimentation. The region produced Mormonism, Millerism, Spiritualism, the Oneida Community, and countless other sects. Charles Finney held some of his most successful revivals there. The region's combination of economic transformation, geographic mobility, and weak religious establishment made it uniquely receptive to new religious ideas.

                <aside class="notes">
                    The Second Great Awakening's Protestant character contributed to intense anti-Catholic sentiment. Evangelicals saw Catholicism as hierarchical, authoritarian, and incompatible with American democracy. Irish and German Catholic immigration increased in the 1830s-50s, intensifying nativist fears. Anti-Catholic propaganda like "The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk" spread lurid (false) stories about convents. Violence included the burning of an Ursuline convent in 1834 and deadly riots in Philadelphia in 1844. The Know-Nothing Party of the 1850s was explicitly anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant. This shows the dark side of religious democratization—while it opened Christianity to more Americans, it also fostered intolerance toward those outside the Protestant evangelical consensus.

                <aside class="notes">
                    By the 1840s-50s, major Protestant denominations split along sectional lines over slavery. Methodists split in 1844, Baptists in 1845, Presbyterians in phases from 1837-1861. Both sides claimed biblical support. Northerners emphasized the Exodus narrative and New Testament's "neither slave nor free." Southerners pointed to biblical patriarchs owning slaves and Paul's instruction to "slaves, obey your masters." These church splits were significant because they removed important bonds of national unity before the political rupture. Historian C.C. Goen argued that church divisions made political compromise more difficult and the Civil War more likely. Religion both promoted reform and contributed to sectional crisis.

                    The Second Great Awakening helped forge a distinctively American Protestant identity. Key features included voluntarism (no state church), denominational diversity, periodic revivals, and moral reform activism. Many Americans came to see their nation as divinely chosen—a "redeemer nation" with a mission to spread Christianity and democracy. This "civil religion" blended Protestant Christianity with American nationalism. Manifest Destiny was justified in religious terms. However, this identity was exclusionary—it marginalized Catholics, Native Americans, enslaved people, and non-believers. The Protestant evangelical consensus was powerful but limited in its vision of who counted as truly "American."

                    The Second Great Awakening's impact lasted long beyond the antebellum period. It established evangelical Protestantism as America's dominant religious culture, created the pattern of periodic religious revivals, and spawned numerous denominations. It made reform activism central to American religion—from abolitionism to the Social Gospel movement to modern Christian activism. It reinforced democratic and populist culture, emphasizing individual choice and experience over institutional authority. It made moral issues and religious voters central to American politics. The awakening's emphasis on perfectibility, both individual and social, became a lasting American trait. Its optimistic, activist, emotional, individualistic spirit continues to shape American religion and culture today.

                        <p><strong>Emphasis:</strong> Doctrinal shifts, religious sincerity, theological debates</p>
                    </div>

                        <h4>Social Control</h4>
                        <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Elite attempts to manage social change</p>
                        <p><strong>Argument:</strong> Revival leaders used religion to control workers and impose middle-class values</p>
                        <p><strong>Emphasis:</strong> Class conflict, industrialization, social order</p>

                        <p><strong>Argument:</strong> Revival religion helped people cope with market economy's disruptions</p>
                        <p><strong>Emphasis:</strong> Commercialization, anxiety, adaptation to capitalism</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>Key Historians and Works:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nathan O. Hatch</strong> – <em>The Democratization of American Christianity</em> (1989): Emphasizes populist rebellion against religious elites</li>
                    <li><strong>Paul Johnson</strong> – <em>A Shopkeeper's Millennium</em> (1978): Argues Rochester revivals were about social control by business class</li>
                    <li><strong>Christine Heyrman</strong> – <em>Southern Cross</em> (1997): Examines how evangelicalism adapted to Southern culture</li>
                    <li><strong>Jon Butler</strong> – <em>Awash in a Sea of Faith</em> (1990): Critiques "awakening" framework, emphasizes diversity</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="conclusion-box">
                    <p>These debates reflect broader questions about religious sincerity, social power, democratization, and economic change in early America. Most historians now recognize the awakening's complexity—it was simultaneously spiritual, social, economic, and political.</p>
                </div>
                <aside class="notes">
                    Historians have debated the meaning of the Second Great Awakening for decades. Some emphasize genuine spiritual experience and theological innovation. Others see it as social control—elites using religion to discipline workers during industrialization. Nathan Hatch stressed democratization—common people seizing religious authority. Paul Johnson connected it to the market revolution and class conflict in Rochester. Christine Heyrman examined how evangelicalism adapted to Southern slave culture. Jon Butler criticized the "awakening" framework as overgeneralizing. Most current historians recognize the awakening was multifaceted—simultaneously spiritual, social, economic, and political. It meant different things to different participants and had complex, sometimes contradictory effects.

                    While both awakenings democratized religion and challenged authority, they differed significantly. The First occurred in colonial seaboard communities with educated Calvinist preachers like Edwards and Whitefield emphasizing predestination and damnation. The Second happened on the expanding frontier with populist lay preachers emphasizing free will and perfectibility. The First prepared colonists psychologically for revolution by legitimating challenges to authority. The Second spawned reform movements, utopian experiments, and contributed to sectional crisis. The First's tone was anxiety and fear; the Second's was optimistic and forward-looking. The Second was more diverse in leadership, methods, and sects produced. Both made religion more emotional and participatory, but the Second went much further in democratizing religious authority.

                <aside class="notes">
                    The Second Great Awakening was one of the most important movements in American history. It democratized religion by shifting authority to ordinary people and emphasizing personal choice and experience over institutional hierarchy. It made Methodists and Baptists America's dominant Protestant groups and established revivalism as a central pattern. It drove major reform movements including abolitionism, temperance, and women's rights. It produced new religious movements like Mormonism and Adventism. It expanded religious participation for women and African Americans. However, it also contributed to sectional crisis as churches split over slavery. The awakening's emphasis on optimism, perfectibility, individual choice, emotional experience, and social reform continues to shape American religion and culture today. Next class, we'll examine how these religious and cultural changes connected to political democratization in the Jacksonian era.
