                    The Second Great Awakening began in the 1790s and lasted until the 1850s. Unlike the First Great Awakening, this movement was more democratic and emotional. Key denominations were Methodists and Baptists. It produced entirely new religious movements and established a providential worldview that shaped American culture.

<aside class="notes">
    <p>Charles Grandison Finney was the most influential revivalist, especially among the northern middle class. A former lawyer, he emphasized free will—anyone could choose salvation. He promoted perfectionism—living without sin. His revivals led directly to reform movements, especially abolitionism. His emphasis on human agency fit perfectly with northern middle-class values.</p>

    <h3>Arminianism</h3>
    <p>Jacobus Arminius began as a devoted Calvinist theologian, trained under Theodore Beza—the successor to John Calvin in Geneva. Yet over time, Arminius grew uneasy with the strict determinism he saw in Calvinist teaching, especially the idea of <strong>double predestination</strong>, which held that God had eternally chosen some people for salvation and others for damnation. Arminius believed this interpretation of divine sovereignty conflicted with God’s justice and love, and undermined genuine human responsibility. His goal was not to overthrow Calvinism but to <strong>reform it from within</strong>, preserving its respect for divine grace while restoring room for human choice and moral accountability.</p>

    <p>After Arminius’s death in 1609, his followers formalized his ideas in a statement known as the <strong>Remonstrance of 1610</strong>, outlining five key points that challenged Calvinist orthodoxy. They argued for conditional election, resistible grace, and universal atonement—beliefs emphasizing that salvation was available to all who freely accepted it. This document directly responded to Calvinist theology, seeking to correct what the Arminians saw as an imbalance that made God appear arbitrary and humanity powerless. In short, <strong>Arminianism was a direct theological reaction</strong> to Calvinism’s emphasis on divine predestination.</p>

    <p>The controversy came to a head at the <strong>Synod of Dort (1618–1619)</strong>, where church leaders rejected Arminianism and codified what became known as the <strong>Five Points of Calvinism</strong>—summarized by the acronym <em>TULIP</em>. Ironically, these Calvinist points only took their definitive form in response to the Arminian challenge. Though condemned at Dort, Arminian thought survived and flourished, especially through <strong>John Wesley</strong> and the <strong>Methodist movement</strong>, shaping much of modern evangelical Christianity. In this way, Arminianism stands as both a protest and a legacy—an enduring effort to reconcile God’s sovereignty with human freedom.</p>

Paradoxically, this ideology both limited and empowered women—it created space for activism in reform movements.

                    The home became a moral refuge and miniature church. Women gained spiritual authority by leading prayers, organizing Sunday schools, and conducting family devotions. Domestic fiction like Godey's Lady's Book taught proper domesticity. These ideals distinguished "respectable" middle-class women from working-class and immigrant women.

                    <div class="pillar-box">
                        <h4>Piety</h4>
                        <p>Women viewed as inherently more religious and moral than men. Spiritual guardians of the family who maintained household faith and morality.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pillar-box">
                        <h4>Purity</h4>
                        <p>Sexual virtue essential for women's moral authority. Purity was a reflection of character and the foundation of respectability. Loss of purity meant social ruin.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pillar-box">
                        <h4>Submissiveness</h4>
                        <p>A "true woman" was gentle, submissive, and acquiescent. Expected to defer to father and husband in all matters—strength shown through yielding.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pillar-box">
                        <h4>Domesticity</h4>
                        <p>Women's rightful domain was the home. Excellence in household management, child-rearing, and creating a moral refuge from the corrupt public world.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="conclusion-box">
                    <p style="font-size: 1.3em; font-style: italic;">Critical Question: How did this ideal both empower and restrict women?</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 1.1em;">It gave women moral authority and a sphere of influence, but it also confined them to the home and justified their exclusion from politics, higher education, and economic independence.</p>

                <aside class="notes">
                    The four cardinal virtues: Piety (spiritual guardians), Purity (sexual virtue), Submissiveness (deference), Domesticity (home as domain). This was a white middle-class ideal that didn't reflect most women's reality. Critical question: it both empowered (moral authority) and restricted (confined to home, excluded from politics and economic independence).

                    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8;">The Second Great Awakening democratized American religion, empowering ordinary people with spiritual authority and fueling social reform movements. This religious transformation reshaped American culture, giving rise to the Northern middle class with its values of self-discipline, moral improvement, and economic ambition. Yet these ideals—including the Cult of Domesticity—primarily served white, middle-class interests, excluding working-class, immigrant, and Black women from respectability's privileges while using moral language to justify social hierarchies.</p>

                    Conclusion: The Second Great Awakening democratized religion and fueled reform. It gave rise to the Northern middle class with values of self-discipline and moral improvement. But these ideals, including domesticity, were exclusionary—serving white middle-class interests while excluding working-class, immigrant, and Black women. Moral language justified social hierarchies.
